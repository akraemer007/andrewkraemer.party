Welcome to my about page.

My name is Andrew Kraemer and this is my blog. If you've made it this far, you probably know who I am already. If you don't thank you for stopping by.

Here's a little bit about myself:

I live in Madison, Wisconsin, where I am a data analyst for a local healthcare start-up, where I get paid to ask questions and make beautiful graphs.

I have too many hobbies for one person, but I try my best to keep up with them. My favorite hobbies include hanging out with friends, playing and listening to music, performing comedy -- whether it be improv or stand-up, reading novels, and pretending that I am actively creative.

I come from a big family. All of the people in my family are unique. I'm very outgoing, but compared to them sometimes I wonder if I'm actually the quiet one.

I take my friendships very seriously. Friendships are like noses. You get to pick them and each one is very unique.

Thank you for stopping by.
