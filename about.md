Welcome to my about page.

My name is Andrew Kraemer and this is my blog. If you've made it this far, you probably know who I am already. If you don't thank you for stopping by.

Here's a little bit about myself:

I live in Austin, Texas, with my wife and my two pups. Austin is also where I work with data for money.

I have a number of hobbies, but over the years I've started to become more selective on which ones I spend my time on. My favorites include hanging out with friends, [writing music](https://album.link/i/1599661267), reading novels, video games, and pretending that I am actively creative.

I come from a big family. All of the people in my family are unique. I'm very outgoing, but compared to them sometimes I wonder if I'm actually the quiet one.

I take my friendships very seriously. Friendships are like noses. You get to pick them and each one is very unique.

Thank you for stopping by.
