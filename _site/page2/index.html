        Five Minute Blog Post
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Feb 2015</span>

    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>My computer at work is taking an especially long time to start up this morning, so I figured I should take a few minutes and write a blog post.</p>
<p>-------//------</p>
<p>First off, <a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/3ZYis9zlG1tR1tQ6zDCTfO">here </a>is a really good playlist I made. I called "The Greatest Thirty Seconds." Unintentionally -- and ironically -- this is the longest playlist I've made.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I haven't written in a while for a few reasons:</p>
<p>First off, I'm lazy.</p>
<p>Second, my last post -- the post about fainting on an airplane -- was far and away the most successful post I've done. The pressure is on.</p>
<p>Third, I've been filling a lot of my time with my new improv class. I'll talk a lot about improv in the next post.</p>
<p>Fourth, I'm trying my best to finish Sho Gun. It's an awesome book, and I've learned a lot from it. I wish I could better articulate why the book is interesting. Usually I tell people, "ShoGun is great. The Japanese thought about everything in a completely different way than the westerners did. They killed themselves a lot." While all of this is true, it's not very insightful.</p>
<p>Fifth, I've been taking myself too seriously. I don't write serious very well.</p>
<p>Sixth, I recently learned that you should still try to do Yoga even if you have a metal rod fuzed to your spine. Even though you can't do any of the poses, you can still say you tried.</p>
<p>-------//------</p>
<p>I've been working on meditating again. I meditate in my car before I walk into work. Sometimes I open my eyes and I see people who park next to me staring at me through my window.</p>
<p>I wave at them.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>Well, it seems my computer is working again. I plan on having another, complete, post this weekend. I just felt I had to share something.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

        Unfasten Your Seatbelt
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Dec 2014</span>

    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>This post is a little different from other things I've done. I wanted to share a story with you today:</p>
<p>I was on a flight headed home after five days with my family. I was in my seat reading Hamlet because I like to pretend I'm sophisticated. I had just finished the scene where the ghost of Hamlet's father commands Hamlet to take revenge on his murderer and put my book down. I'm mentioning this now because later I'll say "I looked like a ghost." This is foreshadowing.</p>
<p>I put the book down for two reasons. (1) My Shakespeare tolerance is low, and (2) I was dangerously close to vomiting in my seat (unrelated to Shakespeare). Not wanting to disturb the man with the glasses next to me, I grabbed the "sick bag" from the front seat pocket and stood to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>As soon as I got out of my seat, I broke into a cold sweat and started to get tunnel vision. I tried my best to keep it cool while I walked to the lavatory. "I think I'm fainting," I thought to myself. "I'd rather not faint in the aisle." I felt my legs slowly giving out, and I grabbed the seats for support.</p>
<p>My vision went completely black. I heard people asking if I was okay. I must have been guided to a seat, but I don't remember exactly what happened.</p>
<p>I vomited in my bag without being able to see. People were trying to be helpful, but they didn't know how to help. I felt people giving me napkins. I had so many napkins, no vision, and very little hand eye coordination. My brain was very hazy. I didn't really have a good sense of what was going around me.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?"<br />
"I'm okay"<br />
"Are you okay?"<br />
I'm fine, seriously. I'm just fainting. People faint. I wish I wasn't making people so nervous.<br />
Beep. "Any medical professionals please come to the cabin."<br />
Medical professionals? They have the wrong idea.<br />
"Are you okay?"<br />
"I'm okay"<br />
"You are not okay."<br />
What does that mean? I'm not okay? I'm nervous. I'm very sleepy.</p>
<p>I was laid down across a row of seats. Phrases such as, "He's in shock." "Raise his legs." and "Unbutton his shirt, I can't find his pulse," slowly registered in my head.</p>
<p>As a result of my legs being raised, my vision came back slowly, and I saw the black and white image of a woman's face above me. She looked like a Japanese ink painting. She asked me questions, and I was able to give answers.</p>
<p>I looked down as another woman was applying a defibrillator to my chest. I looked around and saw fifteen people leaning over their seats looking at me. This made me very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes, I was talking and I could see. I answered a lot of questions to the two nurses who helped me -- both named Anne (thank you Annes) -- and the doctor with the gold chain around his neck (thank you doctor with the gold chain around your neck). After that, they filled me in on what happened.</p>
<p>I had a vasovagal episode, which is an incorrect response to a change in blood pressure. All of the blood in my body went to my core, like it does with hypothermia, which caused me to lose consciousness. This response was do to a lack of eating, dehydration, prolonged sitting, and the change in air pressure.</p>
<p>My face had been entirely blue for a few minutes. "You looked like a ghost," Ann, the OBGYN nurse, said. "So I slapped you repeatedly in the face." I had no idea.</p>
<p>The surrounding passengers were wide-eyed as I sat up. They were concerned and I tried my best to look unconcerned. I was concerned.</p>
<p>I didn't have a pulse. It's hard to not become overly philosophical about this sort of thing, but I'm okay with that because it's how I feel. I thought I would be more scared than I was. I think I actually took it quite well. I realized that death is something that happens. We don't need to be afraid of it -- we shouldn't -- but it is important to be aware of it. It makes me excited to do things and invest in the people who I love. I know it's sappy, but it's the way I feel.</p>
<p>We landed safely. I cracked a few jokes and walked off the plane. I drank five cans of orange juice, and ate Popeyes before going to my connecting flight.</p>
<p>I left Hamlet in the terminal.</p>

        Tom Cruise Is Mentioned Twice in This Blog Post
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2014</span>

    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish I wasn't so impressionable.</p>
<p>The other week I watched Jerry McGuire with Paige. There is one scene where Tom Cruise casually does handstand pushups against a wall. I thought to myself, "If Tom Cruise can do it, I can do it."</p>
<p>There is only one place in my apartment where I can do handstand pushups. The handstand location is a confined space between my refrigerator and my backdoor. Everywhere else I run the risk of either knocking Jared's art off the wall or creating foot prints in our living room.</p>
<p>I learned two things from doing handstand push-ups:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can do a few pushups before my arms give out. It's a good feeling.</li>
<li>The realization that my arms are about to give out while upside-down in a confined space is a bad feeling.</li>
<li>Falling in a confined space while upside-down is a worse feeling.</li>
</ol>
<p>My point is, just because Tom Cruise can do something, doesn't mean you should.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t mean you shouldn’t.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I had been struggling all day to write how interesting it is that some systems are more durable than others. I stole this concept from Nassim Taleb’s book “Anti-Fragile.” Some organizations and social constructs seem to go on forever; they are solid. Other systems fall by the wayside – quickly forgotten. I wanted to explore this concept of long lasting systems within the framework of my visit to my fraternity this weekend. I wanted this to be a persuasive essay, and I wanted it to be <em>good.</em> There was potential to make this a very interesting piece. I know this because Jared told me so.</p>
<p>I couldn't do it.</p>
<p>I would write a few sentences and cringe. "That sounds too faux poetic," I would grumble. I followed this up with, "Andrew, you are pretentious and you don't actually know what faux means." So, I did what most successful writers do: gave up.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish writing came as naturally to me as talking does. I <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">can</span> talk endlessly about everything and anything. I used to be jealous of people in college who complained about having to edit a paper down to the page maximum. I never had that problem in my entire life.</p>
<p>I've changed my attitude. Though it’s not easy, writing makes me think. Writing makes me say what I think more carefully. People forget conversations. Ideas in conversations die with people who speak them. Ideas written down have the potential to live on.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">I guess that's why some systems, such as the written word, have continued for so many thousands of years.</span></p>
<p>Perhaps not being comfortable with writing how interesting long lasting systems are is an indication that it would have been a boring essay. Who knows?</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>In my mind there are two different kinds of movies: Movies that my dad likes, movies that my Uncle Tommy likes. Anything else probably isn't worth watching.</p>
<p>Both my dad and his brother, Tommy, are big movie fans. My dad, I would say, is more of a traditionalist. His favorite movie is <em>Get Shorty </em>starring John Travolta. Other examples of "Dad movies" include:  anything that stars Tom Cruise, Classic Musicals, the Die Hard series, and so on.</p>
<p>Uncle Tommy is a bit more artsy. Though he also likes the classics, he leans towards less traditional movies. They include: Wes Anderson films, and that one Australian indie film that I couldn't understand a word of where everybody died.</p>
<p>You should see the movie “Birdman” as soon as possible. I wasn’t planning on seeing it, but Paige said we should go see it. It's an Uncle Tommy film starring Michael Keaton. It's about a washed up actor who is trying to revitalize his career by doing theater.</p>
<p>The movie is incredibly well done. The acting is killer -- it is a movie about acting after all. The filmography has a very stream of conscious feel to it by the way the camera bounces from character.</p>
<p>It's weird and smart and fun, which happen to be three of my favorite things.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this blog! If you want to talk, reach out to me at <a href="mailto:Kidman007@gmail.com">Kidman007@gmail.com</a>. I like you. Life is short (<a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2009/04/24/on-the-shortness-of-life-an-introduction-to-seneca/">but actually not that short</a>). So let's catch up. We could talk about music or ideas or ideas in music.</p>
<p>If you have any constructive criticism, such as "why don't you ever have a point in the things you write" or “this post was too long and boring”, please let me know. I -- like you -- am working on getting better every day.</p>

        Introspection is So Post-Post-Post Modern
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2014</span>

    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>Some general updates:<br />
-I saw Foxygen live. It was amazing. I saw the show with my cousin, Shawn. We had an awesome time. It was like choosing to walk into a burning building.<br />
-I saw The Rural Alberta Advantage live. I saw it with some work friends and Paige. It was an awesome time, though the opening band made me feel uncomforable.<br />
-Here is this week's playlist. I called it "<a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/1le3FTeKwLBRCeucJD0mtQ">Don't Spoil The End</a>," which is incredibly cheesy.</p>
<p>And now for some babble: </p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I'd like to remove the word "I" from my speech. I find that I am always talking about myself. I'm talking about myself right now.</p>
<p>I understand that my experience is really the only one I can truly relate to, but I still wish I didn't think and talk as if everything was about me. I often find myself interrupting other people's stories just to point out how I have a similar story and can relate to them. Even if I tried, it would be tough for me, however, to communicate if my vernacular did not include the word "I":</p>
<p> The gangly redheaded person who is writing this blog post would certainly struggle with communicating without a common one letter pronoun that rhymes with eye, aye, and goodbye. For one, telling personal stories would be completely out of the question. The redheaded person would either need to tell stories that happened to other people -- which wouldn't always make sense -- or, more likely, he would need to tell stories in the third person. His audience would hate this. Alternatively, the redhead could constantly need to speak as if he was giving a lecture, which would wrongly imply that the redhead has any legitimacy outside of his own experience:</p>
<p>It is always important to avoid speaking of oneself. Removing "I" from your language opens up the opportunity to truly listen and engauge. People constantly busy themselves with their inner monologue -- their inner worries. Thinking in this way closes off the beauty of wider world. Putting others in the spotlight is the best way to bring internal happiness. </p>
<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm working on my voice. It seems that every sentence's subject is the word "I" and it's been tough to try to work around that.  I don't want everything to be about me, but what else would I talk about on a blog entitled: "Andrew Kraemer, Now in Technicolor"? I guess I like using "I" because it makes saying "I don't know" easier. </p>
<p>I don't know. I don't know.   </p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I recently got a year of my life back. It was very refreshing.</p>
<p>Stupid thoughts constantly fly through my head, and I question if  I am doing the right thing in my career. I am doing enough work? Am I doing enough side projects outside of my job description. Do I like my work? Am I leaving enough time for myself? How much do I hate my commute? Am I keeping up with my hobbies? Am I writing my silly blog enough? Am I asking silly questions too much?</p>
<p>With these thoughts I often, and unnecessarily, feel that I am behind. I had a vision that I will be doing something incredible by the time I am twenty-five. </p>
<p>Recently, while foolishly asking foolish questions, I felt a particularly nagging feeling that I was behind on my timeline. "I'm twenty-four and I haven't even discovered what my incredible thing is," I thought to myself. I mentioned this  feeling to my friend, Micah. Micah is the same age as I am.</p>
<p>It turns out that I am actually twenty-three. </p>
<p>This was a relief. I have another year! Success doesn't have a timeline, and -- more importantly -- success is what you make of it. I've decided to stop worrying about inconsequential timelines. Instead, I'll focus on real problems, such as knowing my age and not leaving my lunch on the kitchen counter. If I have time, I'll worry about the word "I" too.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. I realize this post had a bit more "mental wrestling" instead of whimsy, but sometimes you have to write what's on your mind. I miss you. Shoot me a message at kidman007@gmail.com and let's catch up.</p>

        And Now a Word from Our Sponsors
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2014</span>

    <p>Recently I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself to write a really clever blog post. I'd like the post to be funny, interesting, and insightful. I would like that post to be about five-hundred words. I would like that post to be amazing.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just need to forget about your anxieties and hope for the best. Here's to hoping for the best.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I have been really enjoying the band Foxygen. Normally, when I find new music, I will listen to a band only a handful of times before moving on to something else. Foxygen is the exception to this rule. For the past two months I've been listening to Foxygen, specifically the album "21st Century Ambassadors of Peace and Love, seemingly nonstop. I like the band because they are not the best at anything. They are not the most technical band, nor are they the edgiest band. All of their music always sounds a little off for one reason or another. They do, however, have an incredible amount of charm and heart. I like charm.</p>
<p>One of their songs is on <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/0aPLNzwUZ731Ip8LjVigLu">this great playlist I made</a> (I think this is one of my best).</p>
<p>I played this album in the car one day when I was with Paige. We were driving with the windows down and were bobbing our heads. She smiled, looked at me and said, "Andrew, I really don't like this music."</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just crazy. I'll let you make your own opinion.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>My ego has been getting bigger recently. I've noticed this because people have told me. Hearing this hurts my ego, because I've always thought of myself as a humble person, which -- I've realized -- is probably an egocentric comment in itself.</p>
<p>I'm also working on being more thoughtful. Sometimes I get a bit too focused on what is directly in front of me, rather than what is important to me. I'm working on changing my focus back to you, my friends.</p>
<p>I'm my own work in progress, I guess.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I wonder if cavemen were dyslexic.</p>
<p>I was lying awake wondering this last night -- as one does.</p>
<p>If they were, I wonder how they identified it. I'm guessing that the caveman-children were not at caveman school where they would write in their caveman spelling notebooks. I'm also guessing that the caveman kindergartener who had a more difficult time writing words like "moose" and "hunt" and "pizza" would not of had a teacher who identified a problem. It's also likely that the inability to spell correctly would not of resulted in a caveman-parent-teacher conference that would have caused the caveman-parents to be concerned, which would result in the eventual diagnosis of dyslexia.</p>
<p>My guess is that dyslexic cavemen were just cavemen. Situations highlight strengths and weaknesses; strengths and weakness are not absolute or universally applicable, even though it may feel like that sometimes. A caveman doesn't need to be able to read Shakespeare or tell which way left is. He only needs to kill the moose.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I hope you liked this post. I feel like it was a bit all over the place, but that's ok. If you want to catch up or have any feedback, please don't hesitate to email me at kidman007@gmail.com Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a great day.</p>
<p>I'll end this post with a quote by Abraham Lincoln, <i>"Sometimes you need to talk about your weaknesses and then talk about cavemen in order to unite your thoughts."</i></p>
