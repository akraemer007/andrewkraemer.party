    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>I came up with a great idea the other day. I'm happy about the idea because I've acutally talked a few of my co-workers into doing it. Here's the idea: I'm going to bike to work. At first glance, this doesnt sound too impressive, as it is fairly common for people to ride their bike to work. And even when I explain the caveats some of you will still be wondering why this is interesting. But wait! Work for me is twenty-six miles away, and, in order to get there, I'm going to have to navigate the wild streets of Chicago before arriving at the mighty Catamaran Tower. I'm pretty excited. </p>
<p>I recently got a new bike (well, actually it's quite used). When I first saw the bike in the used bike store, it didn't have a front wheel and the handle bars were lying next to it on the floor. When my new friend John pointed at is and said, "this one will fit you," he smiled. He then said, "I'm not done with this one yet, but I've been working on this bike like it was one of my own." From that point on, any logic that went into buying my bike evaporated. It's a great bike and I'm happy to have it.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I'd like to be in a life threatening situation sometime soon. I obviously don't want to die, and I definitely don't want to go through this experience alone. The reason I want to do this is simple; traumatic experiences bring people together in ways unlike any other. You could sit on the train with someone everyday for an entire year and I'd bet that you wouldn't feel as close to that person as you would if the train flew off the tracks and you helped each other survive the burning wreckage (especially if one - or both - of you lose a limb in the process). Another part of me wants to be able to introduce someone by saying, "This is my friend Alphonso. He saved my life in 2014." After that, Alhonzo and I would give a great high five with our left hands and I would say, "We both lost our right arm in a tragic incident at the zoo."</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I really like the idea of moving around in a company. While there is sometime to be said about to having an expertise, something that you can do better than pretty much anyone, I like the idea of having a wide breadth of skills and experiences . The way I see it, it is a lot easier to pick up the basics and be proficient at a new skill than it is to gain an equivalent amount of increased expertise on a skill you are already an expert in. Also, I like the idea of cross fertilization of ideas. It's super neat when you see someone from one discipline find a way to improve another discipline because of their different perspective.</p>
<p>I was worrying for a while about my future and what I would do. Now I think I'll have just a few personal goals and try to get as much crazy and varied experiences as possible in both work and life in general.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>There are two things I'm working on: taking risks and saying no. I've been inundated recently by articles about entrepreneurship, and my brain has had  an inexplicable desire to try keep on trying to achieve goals or projects with a medium to high chance of failure. That being said, I also have a desire to do good work, which requires extended focus and the ability to not bite off more than I can chew. It's weird to have both desires and only have 24 hours in a day. </p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I recommend that you pick up the collection of stories, "Letter from an Unknown Woman," by Stephan Zweig. I've only read the first story , which shares the same name as the collection, and I loved it. I jumped from confused to intrigued to sad in the span of sixty pages. </p>
<p>I discovered Zweig by way of Wes Andrewson.  Anderson's latest film,"Grand Budapest Hotel," was inspired by the works of Zweig. The movie was great and so is Zweig.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>Well, I'm off. I feel like this post was more for me than for youbut that's ok. If you want to be added to the mailing list or just want to say hi, drop me an email at kidman007@gmail.com. I'd love to hear from you. </p>
<p>Edit:<br />
After getting some feedback from a few loyal readers, I realized how poorly edited this post is. Rather than getting frustrated about the poor grammar that I've tried so hard to improve on, I'm going to take this post as a polite suggestion to get some sleep.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 May 2014</span>

    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>I have not written anything in a while. This lack of published material is partly due to the fact that I have been busy with my new appartment. The main reason, however, is that I have been stuggling to write things that I find honest and clever. I've written some honest things, but they were boring. I've written some clever things, but they were absurd. Both things I wrote I don't think people would like reading. </p>
<p>The other day I was writing about the absurd eighties action movie, Running Man, starring Arnold Schwartzenegger. I was trying to explain -- in an honest and clever way -- that I admire Arnold's success. Not many people have the move from Mr. Universe to international movie star to the governor of the largest state in the most powerful country in the world. </p>
<p>I was writing this while standing in my apartment in the dark on my makeshift podium. In addition, Miles Davis' unsettling experimental jazz album, Bitches Brew, was blaring on playing on my record player. There I was, standing in the dark alone, thinking and writing about Arnold Schwartzenegger, with really bizzare music playing in the background, when I got a text from my friend. The message was in regards to a conference call I had forgotten that I had planned to disucuss the logistics of the camping camping trip my group of friends -- also known as the President's club -- were planning this summer. </p>
<p>When I got this text a few things happened in my mind at once. The first was complete and utter disorientation. My brain could not make the cognitive leap from Arnold Schwarzenegger and unsettling jazz music to a phone call with friends. The second thing that I thought of after the text was the absolute absurdity of the situration and what this must look like from an outside view. The final thought I had before calling my friend was, "why the hell am I writing about Arnold Schwartzenegger."</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>There is no playlist this week. Go into a dark room and listen to Bitches Brew. If you really need a playlist. Go <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/1cTGuemGHnGHT5Gb5HqGns">here</a>. It is a weird one.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>Paige has gotten a job offer in Chicago. I'm very proud of her. I'm looking forward to not have to drive three hours to see her -- provided that the Chicago traffic doesn't throw me a curve ball.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>Being sick is weird, but it's not all bad. Last week I had a bit of a cold, which turned into quite a bit of a cold. At first I was fine but I got to the point where I woke up and sounded like Tom Waits. Being the "responsible" "adult" that I am, I was intent on going to despite obvious illness. Jared easily talked me out of this. I'm glad he did because I was miserable, and it was awesome.</p>
<p>I like to think that I do a lot of things and keep myself busy, so I don't usually have the time to wallow in self pitty. It was nice to catch up on that. Even though my head hurt, my sinuses hurt, I was tired, and my nose was raw from blowing my nose so much, it was really nice to do nearly nothing all day. I only left the house once because I found out that we were out of toilet paper. I'm not going to beat around the bush here, it was a terrible realization.</p>
<p>I complained to Paige that I was feeling a little, "Tiredsaddepressed with a splash of 'you are sick and will feel better in the morning. Things are good, you goof.'" Paige helped me better explain this feeling: crabby.</p>
<p>Even after I was done with my sick day, my body took the rest of the week to recover and I was very tired. I feel good now. Being sick is a nice little reminder that of my fragility. It also makes feeling good feel better.</p>
<p>---------//---------</p>
<p>I have two new fitness goals. I'd like to be able to do handstand pushups and I would also like to be able to do pull-ups in my door frame. I tried to do both of these exercises today, both ended in injury.<br />
-------//-------</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my blog. Now that I have settled down my life a little bit and found a coffee shop I like, I think it will be easier for me to write my blog more regularly.</p>
<p>Email me at Kidman007@gmail.com if you want to be added to the mailing list. Please email me, even if you don't want to be added. I miss you and I'd like to catch up.</p>
<p>Love,</p>

    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>I hope you are doing well. I'm doing excellent. I feel electric. I feel pretty alright. I hope you are feeling good as well. Here is a <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/6xIsLnxbAN0CCeBkHBen0Z">sweet</a> playlist. It's called "I'm the Meat, You're the Knife."</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I was thinking the other day, what would a dog write a blog about in a blog post. What would be their focus? What would motivate them? I'm not a dentist, and I don't have much experience with dogs. Despite this I decided that it would be fun to write a blog post as if I was a dog, so bear with me:</p>
<p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>l;jasdfhjk;  ;k;jasdflbhuasdbhjbhjasbu  +56255 ;ljfsaj;hasdilhhlalksdhkjhjksfgy. Woof.</p>
<p>Dogs don't have fingers. That was a terrible idea. I hope I don't post this.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>Let's talk about something more interesting than dogs: my mother. My mom is going to Croatia for two weeks, which is a pretty long time. I don't really remember a time that my mom has been away from the family for that long. Goodbyes with parents are really special. They are awkward and a little sad. My mom said, "I'm going to miss you, honey," and we hugged. Up until this point, our goodbye was a classic family moment full of love. So, of course something would have to go wrong. After our embrace, my mom looked up at me and said, "I used your car. It smells really bad. You must have smelly socks in there." After that, she left to go to Croatia for two weeks without seeing another word.</p>
<p>Classic.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p> I've been thinking about optimism a lot the last few weeks. It is weird because it is a good thing and a bad thing. There is one side to the optimist debate, where I feel most people are, which focuses on problems and potential setbacks, says optimism can lead to not being prepared, not being realistic, or not realizing the gravity of the situation. Then there is the other side, which I think I'm on, that focuses on the possibilities or upside of a situation. I'll also point out that optimism leads to happiness and is healthier.</p>
<p> Both sides have helpful perspectives and a lot of the time I wish I could trade a little bit of the surprise I get from being ill prepared for a little bit more tension overall. Perhaps I'm being overly optimistic about this, but I think that I'm being realistic in looking on the bright side. Though I have gotten burned before, I feel that my attitude usually helps me more than hurts me. I'm making strives to take more precautions to avoid guilt (I don't usually feel anxious, but I will feel guilty if something goes wrong).</p>
<p> Maybe I'll abandon both optimism and not-optimism, which is a more positive way of stating the alternative - more negative - view: pessimism, and go with surrealism.</p>
<p> I think this whole conversation is a monkey. Don't you think so, Zeus?</p>
<p> -------//-------</p>
<p> I woke up in the middle of the night and felt the urge to write something down to put on the blog. I grabbed my notebook and jotted the thought down before i went to sleep. When I woke up I saw this written down. "If you want to be a world champion belly flopper, you have to like like climbing ladders." I guess it's nice to know that my sub-conscience would be a subpar motivational speaker</p>
<p> -------//-------</p>
<p>I had the odd experience of drinking some scotch in someone's apartment without their permission. In fact, I was in this person's apartment without permission. It's a strange situation for sure, but as my grandpa used to say, "Scotch that is stolen tastes better. This is a fact."</p>
<p>My grandpa said a lot of funny things. Another quote of his, which I live by, is,"If you put ketchup on a hotdog or mustard on a hamburger, you are a communist."</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I read <a href="http://lifehacker.com/10-of-the-most-important-life-lessons-i-learned-from-my-1547298543">this</a> article today. It reinforced my desire to do crazy things and take risks. I want to come up with a really crazy idea and run with it. I want to be able to put myself in a position where I can just come up with crazy ideas all day and run with them. I recommend you read the article.</p>

        The Case of the

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>People write for different reasons. Some people write in order to record their thoughts; others get paid write. I'm in a different category right now. I am writing as a literal escape. This is not teenager’s escape from reality by abusing drugs and alcohol type of escape. No, I am writing as an excuse to get out of something – probably work. I am writing in order to trick myself into thinking I am being productive.</p>
<p>And I'm ok with that.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>There are exciting things happening right now. For instance, there is this really cool playlist I made on Spotify. It's called "<a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/2alCBQWgoO1Dhb9I97iuV9">Missing Hat</a>." I hope you enjoy it. You should really listen to the song by Sun Kil Moon because it is an emotional roller coaster. You should also listen to the Turtle Giant song. It will make you stronger and better looking. The other songs are random, but I dig them, so you should check them out.</p>
<p>Though there are many things to choose from, I would say that the most exciting thing that is happening to me right now is that my curly-haired friend, Jared, and I are getting an apartment together in Chicago. I think we will name it something awesome. I’ll nominate "Dudelair." I should talk to Jared.</p>
<p>Moving is an exciting thing. It is not every day you take all of the things you have accumulated over the years as a consumer and move it somewhere else. On top of that you also sleep in a different place, which is cool. I tried to write about the apartment once with words (prose, long form, whatever). The main problem I found with the description was that it was really boring, so I have decided to make a list of "Dudelair" attributes and facts. Hopefully it will satisfy your probing questions:</p>
<p>-It is four blocks north of Wrigley Field<br />
-It is a brownstone building, which means it is old and has high ceilings.<br />
-It has new kitchen appliances<br />
-It has granite countertops<br />
-It has wood floors<br />
-It has a dish washer<br />
-It will have Jared and me<br />
-It has a very clutch in-unit washer and dryer.<br />
-It has friendship<br />
-It has nicely sized bedrooms with nicely sized closets<br />
-With written permission, girls will be allowed visit</p>
<p>The Dudelair will be great. There will be the making of delicious preserves and jams, beer brewing, comradery, cribbage playing, high-fives, high-fours, adventurous cooking, and adventurous eating out (when we are too lazy to cook).</p>
<p>I appreciate Jared's levelheaded and organized approach to life. I hope that he will appreciate my chaotic, disjointed approach to life.</p>
<p>Regardless, fingers crossed - things will probably turn out great. You should come to our housewarming party. It will be at our home and - if everything goes well - it will be warm.</p>
<p>-------//------</p>
<p>I'm very proud of myself, though it is for a pretentious reason. I'm reading Ulysses, which is pretty pretentious in itself. Anyway, I finished what most people consider "The most difficult chapter" – I didn’t understand most of it – and then I finished the longest chapter, which was about one-hundred and twenty-two pages. This means I'm on the home stretch. Though I've liked reading Ulysses, I'm ready to move onto something a little easier. Perhaps I'll read Crime and Punishment.</p>
<p>I think I just contradicted myself.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I'm trying to figure out my five-year plan. You know, asking myself, “What do I need to do in the near future in order to accomplish things I think I'll want to do in the far future.” It is harder than I thought. One question I needed to confront is my work life. Do I want to do hardcore finance or the operations side of the business? Do I need to do more hardcore finance in order to achieve other goals I want?</p>
<p>I think I have decided to try to prepare myself as much as possible for having a cool operations position. I'm not exactly sure why. I have only two things I know that I really want to do in my future professionally: First, I want go to school. I don't know for what or for how long, but I know I'll go back. Second, I know that I want to do a dramatic occupation change. I want to push myself. I want to make myself feel uncomfortable. We will see how that goes.</p>
<p>-------//------</p>
<p>If you want to read something light, I encourage you to read "Stories for Nighttime and Some for the Day" by Ben Loory. It is a unique collection of stories by Mr. Loory. It is interesting because it is the only book that both my brother - who is twelve - and I both really enjoy. If you go <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/498/transcript">here</a> and read act three, you will find yourself enthralled by a story of a man and a moose.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>-------//-------<br />
It looks like my time to escape is coming to an end. I’ll talk to you guys next week. If you want to be put on the mailing list, email me at kidman007@gmail.com. I'm thinking about moving my blog to ghost.org, which means my link might be different next time.</p>

    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>I hope all is well with you. I know things are quite groovy with me. (Speaking of groovy, here is a <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/7IClzoEYckViwa8P7LIOa9">groovy playlist</a>)</p>
<p>You probably have not noticed that it has been a while since my last post. I have noticed. I have one-hundred-and-one excuses why I haven't written in a while. You don't care about any of them, but that's ok. I've been prioritizing other things the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Get this:</p>
<p>I started reading <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ulysses</span>. It is cool. It is hard. I think I like it, but I'm not sure. Sometimes I finish a chapter and I feel like, "Wow, that stream of consciences is just like how my brain thinks, except my brain uses smaller words, and uses less obscure allusions. In fact, I don't know if I think in allusions at all. Actually, now that I think about it, if I wasn't told by other people that there were allusions in this book, I wouldn't think there were allusions in this book. I wonder what I'm going to have for dinner. I'm going to have to cook for myself because mom and dad aren't home. Maybe I'll write my blog. Naw, I'm tired. How is James Joyce a real person? How did he give this book to someone and tell them 'Dude, don't worry. This book is awesome, people will read it forever,' and know it would get published? That would like me posting something on the internet about James Joyce and telling my mom, 'Don't worry, people will totally read this.'I like the book. It's a brain work out, but it's so different than, well, everything I've read. Screw it, I'm ordering pizza. What did I just read?"</p>
<p>It's just like that.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I went to Lawrence for the forty-ninth Great Midwest Trivia Contest. My team was "Cardboard Dave's Soggie Wet Dream." I slept seven hours over the weekend. I made bacon ice cream. I saw a communist rally. I made a number of chodé puns.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't speak French, chodé translates to chode.</p>

<p>Paige is taking intro to micro-economics. I'm very proud of her. She made an econ joke. It caught me off gaurd when she did this. I mean, come on! I'm the one who shamelessly tells "bad" econ jokes. Here it is: she said, "Our relationship is like a market: I demand and you supply."</p>
<p>If you don't get the joke, I recommend spending thousands of dollars and years of your life to go to college. If that doesn't sound like your thing or you already did that and still don't get the joke, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Supply+and+demand&amp;l=1">go here</a>.</p>
<p>Don't google search chode.</p>

<p>I saw <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Her</span> last week. I really enjoyed it. There were several things I really liked about it. One thing I liked wasn't directly about what I got from the movie, rather, I like hearing all of the different reactions to the movie from other people. Most of the reactions are positive and focus on different things. To me, that's a sign of a good movie.</p>
<p>I also really liked how well the movie portrayed relationships. It showed the quiet parts of a relationship; the silly little conversations that couples have can be random or even awkward, but they are still part of the relationship.  I really recommend you see the movie.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. I feel that the way I write is very dependent on what I read. I read a Hemmingway short story last night and I'm having a hard time writing a sentence over five words. Hopefully you enjoyed it.</p>
