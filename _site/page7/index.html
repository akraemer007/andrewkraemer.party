        And How!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Aug 2013</span>

    <p><i>I just remember sitting in my attic with an old record player, listening to And How! for hours on end and thinking to myself, "Why can't I sound like that?" -Thom Yorke<br />
</i></p>
<p>Ever since the fall of 2009 the world famous band, And How!, has certianly changed the landscape of music. It all started when Jared Marchant, who is now the band's manager, discovered the band on a Friday night in Ormsby Hall at Lawrence University during drunken jam session. He recalled how he felt when he first experienced And How!, "When I walked in to the room I heard the music and immediately felt like my ears were hit simultaneously by a bizarre - but perfect - combination of roses and dynamite."</p>
<p>The band steadily grew more popular thanks to Mr. Marchant. The band released their hit "Krunk Punk" which immediately dominated the radio waves on classic rock stations and influenced many young artists, such as Jimi Hendrix:</p>
<p><i>"The Tower" is cool. I can't help but think that the Grateful Dead's Dark Star was somehow influenced by it. All the elements are there. But I suppose that would be somewhat anachronistic, wouldn't it? -Jimi Hendrix</i></p>
<p>Since then the band has released seventy-two albums and shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>The band's latest album, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Let It Be</span>, includes many new ground breaking jams. "Krunktry" is an example of the going back to their southern country roots and their love of america, peace, freedom, bald eagles, openness, and love. It also has a very strong themes of xenophobia and a strong repulsion of communism - especially Chinese communism. Near the end of the star spangled epic, Tony Darling, the band's drummer and Creed-style vocalist, begs the listener to consider what it means to truly be an American by asking, "do you think you get get a DUI on a stallion?" Some call this lyricism brilliant. I disagree. I call it art.</p>
<p>Matt Gunby (Guitar) is confident that their new album will do well as he said in an interview with Rolling Stone, "I think the new album will do well." Tony Darling, on the other hand, stated, "I don't get why we added 'Morning Wouldn't' to the album. It ruins the the whole aesthetic of the album and, lets face it, anyone who buys the album simply will not be maximizing their utility. Without 'Morning Wouldn't,' I would say that it's our best album since <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ninth Symphony? What the Fugue in G minor is Wrong With You?</span>. Seriously, &amp;%$# that song." Karl Mayer (Saxophone) was unable to make as he is currently missing, though he was last seen in the Himalayas barefoot.</p>
<p>Andrew Kraemer (bass) declined to comment.</p>

    <p>I have had an iPhone 4 since January 2011. This phone has been very good to me. We have worked together in order to communicate with other people. I press its screen and it makes letters and messages that appear that I send to both my friends and my enemies. I like that.</p>
<p>We, that is my iPhone and I, have been on many adventures together. We have gone on many long walks and road trips together. I usually - but not always - decide where we go. Everything was perfect with our relationship until the accident happened.</p>
<p>When I say that it is not the phone's fault but mine that our relationship has gone south, I really do mean it. There was that party when I was focusing on my friends and I left the iPhone there and, well, it got stepped on repeatedly. The screen is cracked the the battery life is short, but these are just physical things. The real problem is much deeper. I'm just ready to move on. Since then it was obvious that I would get a new phone. The only question is how long we would be able to put up with each others flaws.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, due to being on my family plan and the 'aggressive' manner my family uses phones, use the only upgrade available would be another iPhone 4. An upgrade from an iPhone 4 to an iPhone 4 isn't really an upgrade. I realize that this is certainly a first world problem, so I will continue with this (damaged but functional) awesome futuristic mini-computer-phone and keep my mouth shut.</p>

        The Tequila and Müstaché Memoirs, or My Saturday at Pitchfork Music Festival
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jul 2013</span>

    <div>If you know me well, you would know that I have been to a fair amount of music festivals. Every festival has its own unique flavor. Some are free and some you have to pay for. Each festival has its own unique crowd. For instance, Warped Tour is filled with people who look like they ride skate boards; I don’t know why, they just do.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This year I went to Pitchfork music festival. This was my second time going so I knew what to expect. The acts are not as big as those at Lollapalooza; nor are there as many people. One you arrive, however, you are immediately exposed to a sea of people sporting trendy sunglasses, tribal tattoos, jean shorts (commonly referred to as “jorts”), mustaches, and craft beer. It is at Pitchfork where this crowd of ironic creative types go to worship their independent music gods.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So naturally I came running to the festival this year.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My cohorts and I arrived at the festival after a nasty traffic ridden drive from Wilmette. Proudly wearing festival battle gear, which includes: my white hat with a bold green “W”, my chuck tailors, high socks, (slightly) short shorts, Ray Bans, and my ‘And How!’ shirt (And How! is so underground), we passed through the entrance of the park. Getting in was a suspiciously stress-free experience considering that I had a freezer bag full of tequila stuffed down my pants. We waded through a sea of culturally relevant shops that had records of bands that I have probably heard of and fairtrade-organic-handmade-vegan leather items. We then purchased our first round of craft beer, cider, and <a href="http://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/chuck-hughes/tequila-lemonade.html">lemonade for the tequila</a> – of course – and made our way to the Green Stage. Here we waited for our first band of the day, the Savages.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Savages was one of the few bands that I was familiar with that was playing that day and certainly the one I was most excited to see. The band consists of four bad-ass women. They released their first album, Silence Yourself, early this year and it is reminiscent of the post-punk bands of the late 70’s and 80’s, such as Joy Division, Gang of Four, and Wedding Present. Though the band is young, they performed with the confidence and control of a band that has been touring for years. I rocked out for the entire set. You could hear the bass crisply dancing along with the rock solid drums. The lead singer was engaging and mysterious and the guitar dissonantly  meandered. It was awesome. While listening to the songs I was quite familiar with I was embarrassingly exposed to what I will call a "Punk Rock Epiphany." This happens when you are trying to identify a punk rock song and can't. This is because every punk rock song sounds pretty much the same. Though the performance was fantastic, I couldn't help but wish that the show was inside. I wanted a dark crowded space to mosh in and feel gloomy. In addition the pale women of the Savages looked like they were getting sun-burnt during their brief stint in the sun. Despite the slight wishes for the show to be indoors, the experience was great on all accounts and it was a fantastic way to begin the festival. If you want to get a good taste of the band I recommend checking out my favorite song by them, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kim-REn8ecg">She Will</a>."</div>
<div></div>
<div>As the next was playing at the blue stage not far in the distance, the Swans - which is simply not a band I enjoy, we refueled on the finest dining Union Park had to offer. We happily gorged ourselves on Chubbie’s hotdogs, cheese fries, and a bag of bacon. We also took this time to continue sampling more craft beers and creative lemonade-tequila concoctions. There was much rejoicing.</div>
<div></div>
<div>After the successful binge, we went back to the Green Stage and met up with many of my family members who arrived late and watched the next band, The Breeders, performed their most famous album, ‘Last Splash,’ in its entirety. Kim Deal, the lead singer of the band, is the former bassist of the Pixies. Despite being twenty years older than when she was when she recorded the album, you could tell that she still knew how to rock out and have good time. It was interesting to see the band make all of the different sounds that appear on the album. For instance, to achieve the odd dissonant voice in the song "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxvkI9MTQw4">Cannonball</a>" Kim shouted into a megaphone, which is pretty punk rock. After playing the album, the band played a few more of their hits thanked the crowed and left the stage.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Our jolly band surged forward after the Breeders ended in order to get a good position for the Headliner that night, Bele and Sebastian. Before the Scottish band took the stage, Paige and I were given the task of getting more select craft beers from the beverage tent. We also desperately needed more lemonade for the tequila. Getting the beverages was easy; bringing six cups back with only two people was quite a bit more difficult. Perhaps it was being in the sun all day, perhaps it was because she has tiny hands, or maybe it was just the ethanol, regardless of what was going on, Paige failed to maintain control of the three cups of beer. She successfully spilled half a glass of Goose Island Green Line all over herself as she attempted to regain control and sit on the ground. As a result, I became in charge of transporting 50 ounces of beverages through a crowd.</div>
<div>Surprisingly, the experience of wading through the crowd of people was far more positive than I anticipated. This is because fans of Belle and Sebastian are like the music of Belle and Sebastian, that is, very nice. I parted the sea of people witha few smiles and thank you’s - kinda like Moses (but not really). In fact, when my Tequila concoction began to fall out of my arm, people quickly rushed to my aid and let me through. If I was to describe my feelings at this point in three words, it would be this: I love hippies.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Belle and Sebastian put on a fantastic show from start to finish. The band began with a fun instrumental track which I later learned was entitled “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa9_BQdfo50">Judy is a Dickslap</a>.” My mother and father bobbed their heads to this song regardless. Some things just should not be explained. The positive energy of the evening would be impossible to extinguish. About half way through the show there was a pleasant drizzle that complimented the pleasantness of this Scottish band. Later, near the end of the show, the band invited about twenty people from the crowd on stage. One woman, a former audience member (now dancer), was dancing with only a bra on. Rather than looking with interest or excitement, the male lead singer simply asked the woman, "Where is you shirt?" and continued singing as if he had not just seen a mostly naked person. I wonder what was going through her mind at that point. I bet it was something along the lines of, "Scottish people have funny accents."</div>
<div></div>
<div>After closing to a singalong of "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeVJlLxGsmo">Boy With the Arab Strap</a>," we left the festival wet, giddy, and thoroughly exhausted. We also had no more tequila. The festival was a great experience and I already can't wait for next year.</div>

        How to Write Your First Blog Post
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Jul 2013</span>

    <p><strong>Step One: Introduce Yourself (feel free to skip)</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone, I'm Andrew Kraemer. I live in Wilmette Illinois. I recently graduated from Lawrence University where I learned (I think) to think. I recently began working for a pharmacy benefit management company called Catamaran as a financial analyst. Don't let my employment fool you - I'm a pretty goofy person. I like to think that I am pretty good at seeing the humor of everyday life. I am remarkably tall. I am redheaded and freckled. I'm also currently dating a wonderful girl named Paige. I have a lot of interests; probably too many for my own good. I love reading. I try to read everything from daily news to Ancient Greek history (translated of course). I'd write more about books now but I  have an agenda to get through. I like coffee a lot. I'd write more about this as well; I feel like I could just do a post on coffee. I have recently begun to meditate. I love music of many different types. I've recently been getting into board games, which I believe is representative of my dark and extensive nerdy side. Something I've come to learn about myself recently as well is that I hate generalizations. If you are planning on say something, say it right!</p>
<p>And yeah... I think that covers everything about me.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two: Explain Why You are Writing a Blog</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Earlier today I was showering and I had a flood of ideas. Here is a small sample of thoughts: "I wish I had a nemesis.", "Do I prefer chaos or order?", "How did I not foresee the twist in that book?" The thoughts exploded relentlessly in my mind. I struggled to think of one thing at a time or just think about normal person things. As the cascade of ideas continued to pop in my head I decided that it might be a good idea for me to write these thoughts down.</p>
<p>I also want a way to share my life with people in my own way. I have many friends that I may not see for a long time now that I have graduated, so I figured it might not be bad idea to share these written thoughts.</p>
<p>Thanks to my liberal arts degree I was able to solve both of these problems with one solution: write a blog.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Write a Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I fully intend on stealing a lot of ideas and information. I'll try to link things but I won't try too hard. Remember, this is a blog we are talking about! It's supposed to be recreational!</p>
<p>I'll try to write once a week. I'll try to put some real thought and some real effort into each post. The writing may be sporadic, however. Like camels.</p>
<p>If I feel passionate about something I may be vulgar about it. I'm sorry if it offends you, goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>Final Step: Write Something Funny or Interesting</strong></p>
<p>I'll leave you (my many fans) with this funny thought:</p>
<p>Babies are incredibly stupid. No amount of love or cuteness can make this statement untrue. Let's dive a little deeper and I'll tell you why I think this.</p>
<p>First off, babies are completely helpless creatures. If I was to walk into a forest and left the baby out of earshot it would certainly be eaten or die of starvation within a very short amount of time. They wouldn't be able to get to safety because are physically incapable of walking because they are too weak. In fact, many babies can't even support their own (mostly) useless heads.</p>
<p>Babies can barely think. They are so stupid that if they see a ball and then if the ball is covered by a sheet, in the babies mind, <em>the ball ceases to exist</em>. That is stupidity that I can not relate to.</p>
<p>Though babies are quite dumb, I must hand it to them, they do eventually become some pretty smart and capable people.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed my first post! I'll post more soon!</p>
