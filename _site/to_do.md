I used [this](https://nikinath.github.io/build-blog-using-github-jekyll) website for my inspiration

- get new url and update this
- shorten tagline
- shorten description
- update licence
- update readonly
- Make my own favicon
- adding photo?
- Socail media buttons
- fonts
- drafts
- google analytics


When you run Jekyll, it creates a folder called \_site with the static website inside it. Every file or folder in the repo will get copied into the \_site folder unless it begins with an underscore.

\_config.yml is the configuration file, which is the first file we are going to change.

index.html is your front page and about.md is a static page. You can add other static pages by creating markdown files (which we will be doing further).

404.html is pretty self-explanatory.

atom.xml is for the RSS reader.

\_includes and \_layouts folders contain the boilerplate HTML required to build the site.

\_posts include the posts that you’ll be…well…posting. They are Markdown files.

public contains favicon information and CSS files.
