        My most random hobby
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Sep 2013</span>

    <p>Listen <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/4p07Se7IJWR7W681322Eqn">here</a> for the playlist made for this week. </p>
<p>I have a lot of interests and a lot of hobbies. In fact, I think that there are not enough hours in the day to give all of my hobbies the proper attention they deserve. The main reason I don't have enough time is because of this whole "working" thing. I usually walk into the mighty Catamaran building at 8:30 a.m. and leave anywhere from 5:30-7:30 p.m. depending on the day (this week had two 7:30 leaving days - oofta). The other main obstacle is my commute, which is usually an hour long each way.</p>
<p>Though I don't have a terrible commute, I made a decision early on that I did not want to spend two hours of my day listening to music and slamming my forehead against the steering-wheel due to a traffic induced rage. As a result, I now actually really enjoy my commute. In the morning I listen to music for a while - a whole album if I'm in the mood - or listen to a podcast. I used to listen to books on tape on my way home, but Anna Karinina eventually ruined that for me. Now I have found a new activity for my ride home: I'm learning Mandarin Chinese. </p>
<p>What? How? Chinese you say?</p>
<p>Being the young professional that I am, I have become interested in self improvement and time management tips and techniques. To pursue that interest I picked up the book The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. The book itself was not that good. It was a typical blockbuster nonfiction book. It has a few really good ideas and A LOT of fluff. I learned from the book that you can do anything if you make it a habit. </p>
<p>After I finished the book, I blinked, opened my notebook and wrote "I am going to learn Chinese."</p>
<p>The decision surprised me. First off, I have always hated languages - even English. When I was younger, I used to say, "I don't use grammar because I write n' speak American," and I meant it.<br /> Despite my original 'hesitation' towards learning languages, I went out and stole Pimslur Chinese on the internet and started my Ni Haos and Wo Hoi Shwa Yin One Mas (I have no idea how to write anything with Chinese characters or proper phonetics, so bear with me). </p>
<p>So far learning has been difficult but a lot of fun. I try to do a lesson once a day even if I had a long day and just want to listen to an NPR report on rabies, babies, or scabies. It's weird. When I try a lesson for the first time I get annihilated and it sucks. However, after I try the lesson again a second time, the language begins to flow a little. I hope sometime soon I can try to find a way to apply what I have learned.</p>
<p>---------//-----------</p>
<p>I decided recently that I am going to learn python, a programming language. Unfortunately, I will need to figure out where this will fall in my list of priorities. Is it above Chinese? Above work? Below working out? </p>
<p>Oh, the choices I must make in my difficult life. Sigh.</p>

        The End of Summer, or: Why Milk is at the Back of the Grocery Store
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2013</span>

    <p>I hear that it has been hot outside but I wouldn't know; I spend the majority of the time the sun is out in an air conditioned cubicle. Despite this alleged heat wave, the transition from summer to PSLS (Pumpkin Spice Latte season)  - also known as fall - has begun. In celebration of the change of seasons, I have created a spottily playlist that is has all of the characteristics of a Pumpkin Spice Latte: sweet, surprising, and most likely disappointing.</p>
<p><a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/1P1kPIyWyo4JIYLZ5KxWuG">End of Summer Playlist</a></p>
<p>The playlist starts out with one of my new favorite songs by King Khan entitled "Born to Die." The song is almost as crazy as the story of the band. For example, after a mental break down, the lead singer of the band, Ahmad Khan, <a href="http://www.spin.com/articles/king-khan-shrines-idle-no-more-merge-records-album-stream/"> joined an all female group of Korean Nuns</a> along with other odd life decisions in order to cope with his depression before releasing this awesome LP. Later in the playlist is a band called <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/aug/29/dawn-midi/">Dawn of Midi</a>. I encourage you to listen to their newest album, Dysnomia, in full. The entire album is improvised but somehow the band - a piano, bass, and drums - sounds sounds like a computer. It's very cool. The final song is a collaboration between Moby and Wayne Coyne. It sounds a little "Hey Jude"ish, but that's ok because I love "Hey Jude."</p>
<p>The playlist is eclectic; but hey, I think it's better than a PSL.</p>
<p>--------------//--------------</p>
<p>Why is Milk kept in the back of the grocery store? Think of an answer now and we will explore some answers in a bit.</p>
<p>As I have mentioned in previous posts, I listen to a few economics podcast in order to keep my economic intuition sharp. Econ Talk, my favorite economics podcast, is moderated professor Russ Roberts of Stanford University. The talks are always interesting, but this week's podcast was so engaging I felt that I needed to share it, despite its mundane title, <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/09/munger_on_milk.html">Munger on Milk</a>. In this podcast, Roberts posts the question, "Why is Milk in the back of the Grocery Store?"</p>
<p>The explanation that came to my mind was milk is in the back of the store in order to force consumers to walk through the whole store and, as a result, increases amount of goods the customer sees and buys. It makes sense right? A grocery store is a firm. Firms are focused on maximizing profits. Because the margins on food are so slim a store tries to get the customer to buy as many things as possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me and my "sharp economic intuition," Roberts destroys my theory. He counters with questions such as, why do store owners clean the floors? Why do they hire cheerful people at the checkout line? The store could save money by cutting these services out and thus make more money. However, thanks to competition, grocery stores have to compete with other grocery stores and have to provide good service. If the store tried to screw over the customer as much as possible, the customer would go to a different store. Competition forces the stores to place things that they are as convenient as possible. Stores that fail to adapt would be abandoned for better organized stores.</p>
<p>Besides, milk is in the back of the store because it is cheaper to stock it in the back for a number of reasons that I won't explain here.</p>
<p>Roberts goes further to encourage people to avoid immediately assuming a firm is out to get them. He concedes that yes, sometimes you are getting screwed over; but, he argues,<i> if you are open to the possibility that firms are trying to serve you in their interest, you will be able to see explanations that you would have otherwise missed.</i></p>
<p>I think that this is AWESOME!</p>
<p>This goes with my whole philosophy of everything. If you take a second to assume the negative case of something, you are more likely to be able to discover new answers. The answers may not be correct, but at least you have a more thorough understanding of the problem.</p>
<p>------------//-------------</p>
<p>Hopefully that was in English. Let me know if there are any glaring errors that bother you and I will fix them.</p>
<p>Let me know if you want me to be on an email list by emailing me at kidman007@gmail.com</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>
<p>P.S. My learning of Chinese has been going well.</p>

        Why a young professional near Chicago lives at home: a cost benefit analysis
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Sep 2013</span>

    <p>I'd like to start by apologizing for the unforgivable tardiness of this post. I've gotten busier with work - which I realize is not an excuse - and I have had a blog post that I have wanted to write but haven't put the effort into fully explore the idea.</p>
<p>Despite my apparent busyness, I have been having a great time as of late. I have had back to back great weekends. One weekend was in Eagle River, Wisconsin, which included a brief but emotionally necessary stop in Steven's Point. Many of my good friends met and we had a wonderfully manly weekend on a lake. This most recent weekend I was in St. Paul, Minnesota; where I got to see a plethora of wonderful cousins and my wonderful girlfriend, Paige. I went to the state fair and ate my weight and the some of various fried skewered "foods" and went home with a smile on my face despite the painful sensation of my gut being dragged on the concrete and occasionally getting stepped on by the "ooooh-I-know-right?"ing locals.</p>
<p>-------------//-------------</p>
<p>I hope we don't bomb Syria. I'm a bit of a pacifist. </p>
<p>-------------//-------------</p>
<p>Listen to Dawn of Midi. It's some of the best music I've heard all summer. It's jazz musicians discovered electronic music and play acoustic. Great stuff.</p>
<p>-------------//-------------</p>
<p>The Nobel prize winner Ronald Coase died at the age of 102. I liked him.</p>
<p>-------------//-------------</p>
<p>Recently I've been thinking about the fact that I live at home rather than the exciting and mysterious city of Chicago. I know that I will be moving away from home eventually, but the question is when will this be happening. In order to better understand my situation, I decided to do a quick cost benefit analysis - ya know, for kicks. In this analysis I will value different parts of the analysis with "Kraemer Republic Action Points," which will be referred to as KRAP. Though the points will not be tied to dollars in any way shape or form, I can tell you I give about 300 KRAPs a month to pay my car loan.</p>
<p>Cons of living at home:<br />
You have to tell people you are living at home:<br />
Now this might not sound like a big deal but, I must say, it is weird telling people that you are living at home even though you have a job and could technically afford your own apartment. People will reenforce your decision and act be excited when you tell them you are living at home. However, these same people's faces will light up when they hear that you are living down town. They lean in closer and ask what neighborhood your are in, what are your cross streets and what festival you went to that weekend. Saying you live at home is boring. I'd say I give about 150 KRAPs a month about that.<br />
You aren't in the city:<br />
Young, goodlooking people like myself live in the city. I like young people and I like fun things. For instance, this weekend there is a Guinness and Oyster festival. I'd say I give about 300 KRAPs a month to live in the city.<br />
You have a big close (and frustrating family:<br />
My family is great but sometimes I just want a little time to myself. One time I went into my room to get away for a little bit after a long day at work and not one, not two, but three of my family members burst into my room unannounced. This can be draining. I'd say I give about 237 KRAPs about that.</p>
<p>I know that I've been talking a lot of KRAP about living at home, but there are definitely some positives as well.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>No rent/ other cost savings<br />
I save a ton of KRAP by living at home. Rent in downtown Chicago would like be dumping all of my KRAP down the toilet. I'm probably saving 600 KRAPs per month on rent.</p>
<p>Family:<br />
Though I love to complain about my family, I must say - I really like being with them. It's fun to watch tv shows with my brother Daniel. I like driving my sister Diane to school in the morning. Life is good at home. I give a lot of crap about my family about 340 KRAPs!</p>
<p>Now that I'm a financial analysis I know math. With my math skill I figure that I'm saving 253 KRAPs per month living at home. Ain't that nifty. If, however, I develop an acute distaste for my family or I give less KRAPs about money I'll move out. Despite this, I get the feeling that an external something will push me towards the big city. I don't know what that something is, but until then ill be chilling with my brother.</p>

    <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2013</span>

    <p>I have a lot of random things I would like to explore and/or remark about, so please bare with me on this post.</p>
<p>First off, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/6VnPRSlK3uvAoDqnbw65wt">here</a> is a Spotify playlist of cool <b>tunes</b> I have been rocking out to. Props to my cousin Tommy for recommending a few of these songs. Tommy is a DJ and you should check out the songs he has made <b><a href="https://soundcloud.com/hot-mischief">here</a> on his sound cl<b>oud</b></b>.</p>
<p>Second, I annihilated my tongue on a cup of coffee on Monday and today - Thursday - it still hurts. I probably deserve it.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Monday I was in an especially great mood. In fact, I felt like <span style="text-decoration:underline;">this</span> the entire day (1).</p>
<p>Part of the reason I feel this way is because my company moved to a really cool new building in Schaumburg. It has modern design things everywhere. I have my own cube, which I have already pinned on my wall a sheet of excel hotkeys and a picture of my own face. We have a cafeteria that reminds me of Bon Appetite - the good food service my school used - except even better! I also get to sit next to my team which is awesome. Though we work hard for most of the day, we do have our bursts of goofiness. These goofy moments include, but are not limited to, shirtless Bon Jovi themed birthday cards (don't ask and no, it was not my idea), launching notes to each other with rubber bands above the cube walls, and a mini game of bags. Needless to say, the transition from my crappy old building to this modern Google-wannabe building is awesome.<br />
--</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have statistics on your entire life? I think about it all of the time. Thoughts such as, "how many cups of coffee have a drank in my life?", "what days do I drink the most cups of coffee on average?", or "How many hours have I actually been using my brain today?" I feel like it would be so cool to know everything about myself, because - lets be honest - we typically don't know ourselves as well as we think we do.</p>
<p>I'll probably write about this more at some point, but for now just let that thought bounce around your head</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I'm currently reading the fantasy novel <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sabriel</span>. I’m enjoying the story though I’m not sure I would recommend it. The story is interesting enough but it is definitely a book for a younger audience. The prose is often awkward and I have a hard time connecting with the characters.</p>
<p>After I finish this book - which I am hoping to do tonight – I will begin the hard-boiled crime thriller <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Double Indemnity</span>. It looks like a really fun, short, and classic read. The book was recommended to me by Prof. Podair. I have a feeling he has good taste in crime thrillers.</p>
<p>I'm so sleepy. I hope the post was in English.</p>
<p>---------------//---------------</p>
<p>(1) That is, I felt really good like the song - not like the video. If I felt like the video I feel like I would be implying that I was totally warped on acid, which I certainly was not.</p>

        Donuts and Innovation
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2013</span>

    <p>I love innovation. I love change. Innovation and change lead to improvement in all sorts of things. I like that. To me, <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/images/view;_ylt=A0PDoKnTWQZSJRoACKyjzbkF;_ylu=X3oDMTF1b2M2ZzQ4BHNlYwNmcC1leHAEc2xrA2V4cARvaWQDOWMwZTYzZjRjZmQ1MzhkZmVkYTdhMzFhMWE4YzI1Y2EEZ3BvcwM4?back=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%3Fei%3DUTF-8%26p%3Dschumpeter%26type%3D571829%26fr%3Dspigot-adr-ffmac&amp;w=305&amp;h=400&amp;imgurl=hightechhistory.files.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F01%2Fschumpeter1.jpg&amp;rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhightechhistory.com%2Ftag%2Fj-p-morgan%2F&amp;size=19.3KB&amp;name=Joseph+Alois+%3Cb%3ESchumpeter%3C%2Fb%3E&amp;p=schumpeter&amp;oid=9c0e63f4cfd538dfeda7a31a1a8c25ca&amp;fr2=&amp;fr=&amp;tt=Joseph+Alois+%3Cb%3ESchumpeter%3C%2Fb%3E&amp;b=0&amp;ni=160&amp;no=8&amp;ts=&amp;tab=organic&amp;sigr=11aqbraij&amp;sigb=12kk739jj&amp;sigi=11rk3hlds&amp;.crumb=E9o3.hs/eoh&amp;">Joseph Schumpeter</a> - an innovation focused economist - is more than a hero to me; he is a friend. Innovation is constant and competitive and beautiful and I love that. But today at work I experienced what it is like to fail and be disappointed when you try something new.</p>
<p>The day began like most other days. I cruised to work listening to podcasts and trying - futilely - to learn Chinese. Because I had a long and productive week in the office and that it is the last day in our current building, I figured that I would a pretty easy day.</p>
<p>I could not have been more wrong.</p>
<p>The email came in at 9:16 from Christina. It was entitled 'Donuts.' I perked up and rose from my seat. The prospect of a sugary treat made my mouth water. I followed my nose to the tray of donuts. There were donuts of all types. I reached my hand out towards my favorite kind of donut, strawberry frosting. Then, I stopped myself and thought, "What would Schumpeter do? Why don't I try innovating my donut eating habits?"</p>
<p>My eyes drifted over the trans-fat-filled sugary delights and I saw a beautiful donut. It had white frosting, some mysterious crunchy flair on the top, and it was filled with a cream that I could not see.  I heard it calling to me so quickly grabbed it and ran back to my desk with a cup of coffee. The first bite was delicious. I love the way that cream filled donuts feel when you get a bite without cream. Then I took another bite and despair flowed through my entire body.</p>
<p>It was filled with lemon cream.</p>
<p>It's not that I don't like lemons. It was just not what I was looking for; especially when compared to the serene beauty of the strawberry frosting donut.</p>
<p>The moral of the story, I guess, is that even though trying new things can lead to beautiful innovations and grand new experiences it is also risky and may lead to failure or dissapointment. It is important to note, however, that these disappointments and failures are good for us. We learn more about what doesn't work and and the nice things about we know.</p>
<p>Keep failing (you just might learn something).</p>
