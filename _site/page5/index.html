        Andrew Kraemer: Caring Zebra
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Dec 2013</span>

    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>It has been a while since my last post and quite a few things have happened. In an effort to not bore my beloved reader to death, I have provided a list of events and non-events that have happened to me recently:</p>
<p>-I made a playlist for this week. It is called “<a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/4fEl17cjufCms9XM4OHgCR">Go Forward!</a>” All of the songs are really good.</p>
<p>-I left my keys in my trunk’s keyhole all day while I was at work. I couldn’t find them until eight p.m.</p>
<p>-Paige came down for an entire week. It was awesome. We watched shows, ate delicious food, and sassed each other constantly.</p>
<p>-I made a ridiculous amount of Christmas cookies.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I really like this week’s playlist. The first song, “Divisionary (Do The Right Thing),” moved me when I first heard it. It is a straight forward sing along song. It is positive but with a sad tone. For some reason this song made me very nostalgic of playing with my band, And How!, because it sounds like a group of people who are messing around with their instruments and having a lot of fun.</p>
<p>The second song, LCD Soundsystem’s “All My Friends,” made me think and be thankfull for all of my friends. It is also just great music.</p>
<p>The other tunes are just songs that I thought were really good. I hope you like the playlist as much as I do.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>There are a few people in my rotational program. We are all recent graduates from college and get along very well. One of them asked if I would be interested in starting a book club.</p>
<p>I was hesitant.</p>
<p>I love books. But I barely have time to read the books that I am interested in. For instance, I have been slogging through Pillars of the Earth for about two months now (I only have about one-hundred pages left but I have not been able to find the book. I don't know how keen I am on finding and finishing it, though). I have a pile of books that is constantly growing next to my bedside table that I don’t read. Among others, my pile includes a Russian history book, a book about how cool classical music is, various fiction books, and an intimidating corporate finance text book.</p>
<p>I know I’ll get to these books sooner rather than later but a book club would do one of two things: I would have to put the books in my pile on hold for a long time, or I would have to try to trick the other readers into reading the random and eclectic books on my shelf.</p>
<p>Instead, we are going to be doing an audiobook club. I’m very excited for this. It’s the best of both worlds. I’ll be able to read my own books and still be able to discuss books with other people like I did at school.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions for good book club books, let me know. I’m thinking about recommending Hemmingway’s <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> and a sci-fi book called <i>Snowcrash</i>.</p>
<p>------//-------</p>
<p>The other night I was sitting in my car idling as I waited for the light to turn green. My mind was wondering. I was thinking about either a lot of things with no structure or nothing really at all. In other words, I was not paying much attention to anything at all. The light turned green. As my mind crept back into reality, I noticed a white Interceptor quickly crawl into the intersection and quickly accelerate into the darkness beyond. After driving for a minute I caught up to the cop car which had pulled over another car. </p>
<p>I thought to myself, “What an idiot. Why would he speed here? The cops always pull people over in this area. <i>He deserves what he gets</i>” I continued pondering and changed my mind, “Regardless, that could have easily been me. That guy’s going to have to pay a ticket and everything now.”</p>
<p>For whatever reason, I continued to ponder about why I reacted in this way about a mundane traffic violation. My imagination took a leap. I thought the cop was like a lion or a cheetah, which was hiding in the tall Saharan grass waiting to pounce on its unsuspecting prey. The victim was like zebra. It was separated from the heard and was taken down by the predator.</p>
<p>Of course, this logic meant I was also a zebra in the heard.</p>
<p>I wondered if actual zebras had thoughts like this. Were they indifferent to the herd? Did they continue on with their lives – living as if the herd was only a group who provided protection? I was surprised that like the zebra I had no affection for the people around me. In my mind my fellow commuters are merely a heard of powered metal boxes that happens to be going in the same direction. We follow the same rules not because we want to but because it is convenient and safe for us on our journey.</p>
<p>As a result of this mostly crazy logic I’ve decided to take extra care of being aware of the people around me. I don’t need to know who they are or what they do, but I want to make the effort to realize that the people around me are – in fact – people. Why?</p>
<p>Perhaps I just I want to be a caring zebra.</p>
<p> </p>

        Buttons: What's the Point?

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Nov 2013</span>

    <p>I'd like to start this post off by celebrating Paige again. Today is her birthday! If you see her celebrate the fact that he has been alive for twenty-three years. If you want, you can also celebrate the fact that she is a great person.<br /> -------//-------<br /> <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/0gwMS7h6XWoZN4pIVrTQJ9">Here is this week's playlist</a>. The theme is: music I like to listen to right now. We've got some soul, some rock, a little folk, and a weird sampling thing. <br /> -------//-------<br /> I've been reading the book "Pillars of the Earth" for what has seemed to be the last five years. I highly recommend reading Ken Follett's work, especially if you are on a beach or recovering from a Turkey coma. This book, however, I am more hesitant to recommend. I'm currently six-hundred pages in with four-hundred left to go. In my opinion, the characters are too one demential. The good guys are <i>so</i> good and the bad guys <i>such</i> bastards. That is, the bad guys are not actual bastards, rather, they are just really big jerks. Perhaps I'll change my mind after another eon of reading and four-hundred pages.<br /> Speaking of bastards, I'm reading a book called "Voltaire's Bastards." It critiques western societies' obsession with rationality. It is really interesting. Some parts I agree with and other parts I vehemently disagree with. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for an intellectual read, regardless of your opinions.<br /> -------//------- <br /> This past weekend I took the 'L' train down to Lincoln Park. I met with some good friends. We planned on making dinner, drinking delicious beer, going to a few hip bars, and thought going to a comedy club.<br /> I wore my new winter jacket with a scarf. My new jacket has buttons.</p>
<p> Wearing a jacket with buttons has always seemed to be a silly thought to me. I remember seeing my friends my freshman year of college wearing jackets with buttons and scarves and thinking, "Why are they doing that? That jacket doesn't look that warm and I bet the buttons fall off all of the time." Compared to the button, the zipper is clearly the more innovative, advanced, and, not to mention, secure fastening device. Why would anyone buy an inferior product for more money? I was utterly perplexed. All of this judgement of the buttoned jackets culminated to the decision that I would never buy a peacoat. It was a life of zippers for me. Efficiency over fashion! Truth over superficiality! Warmth over buttons.</p>
<p> But, four years later, here I was, standing in Lincoln Park wearing a jacket with buttons like a troglodyte.</p>
<p> I greeted my friend who, looking good as always, was also wearing a jacket with buttons. Standing next to us was a group of young 'Professional Looking' men and woman also wearing jackets which have buttons.</p>
<p> What's the big deal?</p>
<p> This is about when I had a — mostly undramatic — crisis of conscience. Had I changed? Had my values changed? Am I now more of a mindless consumer following the herd of fashion-interested idiots? It seemed that something terrible had happened to the boy-man named Andrew Kraemer who for years wore a truly unfashionable zippered jacket that he bought out of necessity for twelve Euro.</p>
<p> Or, I thought to myself, is there possibly value in dressing this way?</p>
<p> There are many ways in which people evaluate us. People can read or evaluate our work (or blogs). They can observe how we treat other people or how we participate in our communities. However, the easiest and quickest way to evaluate someone is to simply look at them. It's something we as humans can't help but do. We have evolved in such a way that we make judgements instantly and subconsciously about people based on the way they look. As we learn what certain people are like based upon their appearance, we have learned how to influence these immediate judgements with the way we dress.</p>
<p> Perhaps part of me wants to look like a young professional, rather than that gangly guy who wore the ugly coat, even if it betrays my love of innovation. Of course, people take the idea of fashion and its value to extremes, but I think an equal number of people are doing themselves a disservice by ignoring any benefits of dressing well.</p>
<p> So there you have it, a reason to have in efficient buttons on your jacket. Spend away my friends. But I could keep going and explore the question more. There is the question of waste. Is there wasted material that goes into the buttons? Is there wasted effort on aesthetics rather than need? Why not invest in a single jacket that can withstand anything and it doesn't matter if it gets dirty? On the other hand is it waste if it creates value for both the person wearing the jacket and the person who makes and distributes the jacket. What if you had not bought that jacket and it impacted a whole ecosystem of friends who also got similar jackets and created wealth and a higher standard of living for the buttoned jacket maker?</p>
<p> I guess what I'm saying is that I have a hard time buying things. But, goddamnit, I like this jacket buttons and all. </p>

        The Graduate, Leprosy, Courtney Barnet, and Chocolate-Dipped Science
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Nov 2013</span>

    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p><a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/7xWHg940OAvn0w78xe0CAo">Here</a> is a link to this post's playlist.  I found the first song on the playlist, "Number 9," by Moon Hooch completely on accident. The band consists of two saxophone players and a drummer. Despite the bare-bones set up, Moon Hooch will get your booty moving.</p>
<p>Two of the songs in the playlist have the title "Heart" because why not. </p>
<p>Courtney Barnet's song "Avant gardener" is fantastic. Though I typically have trouble hearing and - as a result - caring about lyrics, I have found myself completely drawn in by Barnet's wordplay. I love how she delivers her lyrics as if they were a stream of consciousness but if you listen you can hear all of her incredibly and clever lines. Here is a taste:</p>
<p>"The paramedic thinks i’m clever cos i play guitar<br />
I think she’s clever cos she stops people dying<br />
Anaphylactic and super hypocondriactic<br />
Should’ve stayed in bed today<br />
I much prefer the mundane."</p>
<p>She reminds me a bit of the late Lou Reed of the Velvet Underground. Like Lou, Courtney delivers her lyrics dryly over a pretty simple chord structure. However, there is definitely some magic behind what she is doing. At least, that's what I think.</p>
<p>------//------</p>
<p>This weekend I saw The Graduate for the first time. After the first fifteen minutes, I knew that this was going to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. I think that part of the reason I had this reaction is because I alway have mixed feelings before watching a movie that has been deemed a classic. I always want to enjoy classics because of the impact they have or had on art, but sometimes classics don't age very well. The Graduate pulled me in from the first scene. The camera keeps the viewer uncomfortably close to Dustin Hoffman's face as he awkwardly meets with friends of his family. I could go on, but I just recommend getting a big bowl of popcorn and watching the movie yourself if you haven't seen it.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I try to be as open minded as possible and accept people for who they are, and, for the most part, I like to think I do pretty well. I try to reserve judgement until I have met someone, I and look at gossip with sceptisism. There are, however, some people that I don't think I could be open to in more than just a friendly way. </p>
<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think I could date a leper.</p>
<p>It's not that I think that lepers are evil or that they aren't good people; rather, I just feel that there are a few too many barriers that would make the relationship work. First of all, leprosy is contagious and, well, I don't want leprosy. Second, even if it wasn't contagious, there are lots of things I couldn't do with my leper girlfriend. Say we were staying in (because we would always stay in because she would be a leper) and we agreed about something cool and exciting and highfived. What if I hit her hand clear off? Not only would it would be incredibly dangerous, but it would also be awkward for both of us. That is the sort of situation I just don't want to be in. And finally, I don't think I could date a leper because I am very happily dating and in love with Paige Koebele. She is wonderful, talented, beautiful, and (fingers crossed!) does not have leprosy. She makes me very happy. Our three year anniversary was on November sixth and I couldn't be happier. </p>
<p>So take that, single lepers. </p>

<p>Also, you should let me know if you want to be on the distribution list of my blog. I can hook you up, yo.</p>
<p>I think that in future posts I am going to try to take more care with my writing. Lately, I have been typing as quickly as possible with minimal planning and editing in order to get a post out sooner rather than later. Part of the reason I'm doing this is to improve my writing.</p>

        Freud, Short Stories, and Giving Up on a Book
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2013</span>

    <p>I hope you are doing well because I feel great today.</p>
<p> Here is the link to this post's playlist. It's entitled: "<a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/79813DUszgCe5CqWJGB97P"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Walking Around the House Naked at Two in the Afternoon</span></a>." It's a pretty random collection of songs. I am particularly excited about <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pretty Green</span>, which is a new White Denim track. White Denim puts me in a mood that very few other bands can achieve. A feeling - no! A need to put my fist in the air and smile. (Editors note: Andrew Kraemer has been seen on multiple occasions raising his fist in the air with a determined, but triumphant, look on his face in his cubicle.)</p>
<p> -------//-------</p>
<p> I picked up fifty-three volumes of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Britannica's Great Books of the Western World</span> the other day from a rummage sale for thirty dollars. If you have an extra copy of volume fourty-one, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (Part II)</span>, let me know. It's the only volume out of the entire set I'm missing. I have mixed feelings about my purchase. I'm excited because there are a lot of really great books in there. On the other hand my reading list is already so long and I just put another fifty-three books on it. And when am I going to have the drive to go through some of these books? When am I going to sit down and tell myself, "Andrew you're going to read hundreds of pages of Freud today."? At the very least, I have fifty-three fancy paperweights.</p>
<p> -------//-------</p>
<p> I wrote a short story. It's not very good but that's ok. You can't expect your first time trying something to end up great.</p>
<p> It's about a guy who is being stalked by these two mysterious figures. The scene stops abruptly and continues. Many details change, such as location, charachters, and object at the reset of the scene. At the end you learn that every disjointed scene is just a guy trying to finish his dream but is interrupted by his alarm clock. I thought it was clever.</p>
<p> -------//-------</p>
<p> In my opinion, it is always sad to give up on a book. I mention this because I gave up on a book yesterday. The book was Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis. According to the back of the book, it is, "Regarded by many as the finest, and funniest, comic novel of the twentieth century." I respectfully disagree and call bullshit on that comment.</p>
<p> I really wanted to enjoy the story. But after 100 pages I found myself not caring.</p>
<p> When is it ok to give up on a book? Let's ask ourselves a few questions before we abandon the book.</p>
<p> 1. Did you lose your bookmark?</p>
<p> This is not a valid excusue.</p>
<p> 2. Are the characters too stupid for you?</p>
<p> Sometimes the characters in a novel make repeated poor decisisons. Sometimes the characters are so foolish that it breaks your willing suspense of disbelief. If you have been dealing with stupid charachters, close that book.</p>
<p> 3. Is the book not at all what you expected in a bad way?</p>
<p> Being surprised by a good book is a great feeling. For instance, I read "The Passage" with absolutely no background other than a friend telling me, "Dude, I read this 1000 page book in like a day. It was awesome." With no background other than that it was probably a horror story ("Steven King called 'The Passage' a dazzling world" was on the cover).</p>
<p> This is not always the case. It took me a long time to read "Lord of the Rings" because I expected an action novel rather than an adventure.</p>
<p> Give books that do this to you a chance - I'd say give it 100-150 pages. If the book still isn't clicking. Throw it out the window and dig it out of your garden a year from now.</p>
<p> 4. Are you incredibly bored?</p>
<p> There's a chance you are reading a book that is too easy for you. More likely, however, the book is above your reading level, which is a shame because the book is right up your alley but you just can't appreciate it because of your brain.</p>
<p> 5. Are you in a substantial amount of emotional or physical pain?</p>
<p> I understand that a book can play with your emotions and this can cause some emotional pain. But this pain is the emotional and psychological roller-coaster we want from a book. I'm talking about bad pain. I'm talking about that pain you get when you are reading Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time" expecting a fun and easy science read. That, my friends, is the stinging pain of surprise and disaointment. If you are experiencing this, I encourage you to put down the book and walk to the nearest library and go to the children's section and read "Nate the Great" until you feel better.</p>
<p> --------//--------</p>
<p> Email me at Kidman007@gmail.com if you want to be put on the email list.</p>
<p> I have a lot of things I want to write but not enough time! I start an online finance course on Monday. Despite this, I will continue to post as much as I can.</p>
<p> I think I'm going to sit down and read hundreds of pages of Freud now.</p>

        Some Words on Writing
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2013</span>

    <p>Hi, how are you? I hope you are having a good [insert time of day]. I'm doing pretty well [insert your name]. Thanks for asking. I encourage you to read "I'm the Knife You're the Knife" from this week's issue of the New Yorker. It's the best short story I have read in some time. </p>
<p>---------//---------</p>
<p>This [insert time period until next post]'s playlist. <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/30UUHS0a8f6kMgpCGvLNAH">Here</a> is the link. I hope you like it. I like it because it has good music.</p>
<p>---------//--------</p>
<div>It has only been in the last couple of years that I started to enjoy writing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This enjoyment has manifested itself in a few ways. One of the more obvious ways I write for enjoyment is in a small black jouranal I almost always keep in my pocket. I like doing this for two reasons. First, I like to think that I'm an active person, so it makes sense for me to always have a journal with me, rather than keep it untouched in some well lit room with a comfy chair, calligraphy pens, books on all of the walls, classical music lightly - but not too loudly - playing in the background, and a large wooden desk that smells of rich mahogany. The second reason I keep the small notebook is because it is a real pain in the ass to carry around and if I didn't write in it I would feel like an idiot.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh, and I also write a blog.</div>

<div>It took me a long time to like writing because for so long I thought I was bad at writing. I have a clear memory of being in kindergarten and having to write in a journal. I remember all of the other kids writing quickly and then going and playing with toys, but I was stuck sitting for what felt like hours with my teacher, Mrs. Turner. I trying to write, "I like to eat pizza." It was hell. In high school I thought my writing was fine, not exceptional, but fine. It was in College when I began to feel self conscience about my writing. Many Lawrentians claim that they really begin to learn how to write during Lawrence's trademark "Freshman Studies" courses. I, on the other hand, watched Bill and Ted's Excellent Journey in my class and learned nothing (the professor no longer teaches at Lawrence). It was when I started to actually care about learning when I began to think I was a bad writer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would spend hours and hours writing a single paragraph. I would be dissatisfied with the structure or a small grammatical element, try to correct it, then be dissatisfied with the correction, try to correct it again, realize the flow did not work, and then get frustrated and rewrite everything all over again. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I eventually came to terms with myself and decided that though I can make grammer mistakes and I don't always say things exactly how I want to say them, I can write well enough to enjoy it. Writing the blog has been really good for me because I can play with words and get better, or I can just type as fast as I can to share some of my goofy thoughts.</div>
