    <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2014</span>

    <p>Hello Friends, </p>
<p>I had a great time in New York this weekend.</p>
<p>The journey had a few bumps along the way, but, after landing in Newark at one-in-the-morning -- rather than the intended airport, Laguardia, at eleven-thirty, I knew the trip was going to be memorable. I stayed at my Aunt's apartment on the lower west side of Manhattan. In the morning, I had four cups of coffee, ate delicious Chinese food, and talked about life with my aunt. Life's a good conversation topic; it beats the news. My aunt has a very interesting life.</p>
<p>I left my aunt and met up with my friend, Andrew, in one of the oldest coffee shops in New York. We planned our day. And then we walked. We walked all over the place. Sometimes we walked into parks that were on train tracks. I don't know what they are called, but they were beautiful. Sometimes we walked into bars. While we walked we talked. We talked a lot about ideas. We often disagreed with each others ideas, but we always listened to each other.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we sat on the roof of Andrew's apartment in Astoria. He has a great view of the Manhattan skyline which we enjoyed over a few beers.</p>
<p>It was right around this time when I realized that I was allergic to cats. My allergic reaction resulted me sneezing an <i>incredible</i> amount, and my entire face -- especially my eyes -- swelled to the point in which <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ADdOviil.jpg">I was not recognizable</a>. I also had a general feeling of foreboding. It's interesting having your body react violently to something as harmless as a kitten -- especially such a nice kitten. It's almost sad that cats, though very cute, are now no more to me than poison. That's ok, though. There are always dogs.</p>
<p>I was planning on going to the MoMA on my final day before catching my flight. This didn't happen. Instead, I sat in a nice coffee shop chugging coffee to counteract the effect of the Benedryl so I wouldn't fall asleep and miss my flight.</p>
<p>I had a great time in New York this weekend.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2014</span>

    <p>In an effort to come out with more regular posts, I've decided to make some of the posts shorter. This is one of the short posts. Over the last year-or-so of writing the blog, I've developed a bit of a standard format to the blog. It often looks something like this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>A brief, often humorous, and occasionally odd introduction. This is usually an observation that doesn't warrant further investigation. It's usually just something I noticed. For example, I could write about <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Pey8ijf.png">this</a> Excel art I made while I was on a phone call.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A link to my playlist of the post that almost no one will listen to. I listen to it, which is why I say 'almost'. I'll mention a few tracks I really like and why I really like them.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A slightly longer "essay." Normally when I write these I just write about something I've been thinking about a lot recently and distill it into around three-hundred to five-hundred words.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Another brief and humorous -- often self-deprecating -- observation. Perhaps it's an awkward moment. Perhaps it's an admission.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Another "essay" of sorts. Usually, if I've gotten people to read this far, I'll write about something that I think is a bit more serious. Usually it still ends up being a little silly -- which I can't always help. I like to think of this part as a "writing in a journal" section.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A thank you to the readers and a comment -- without fail -- that states my frustration at the infrequency of my posts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And that's it. That's what I do. I like the format. I think it allows me to hit a bunch of different topics without needing to dive too deep into anything.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think like writing this way because I don't like writing in detail. I assume that the reader understands all of the thinking that goes into each post. Paige and Jared hear each "essay" eight or nine times before I actually write anything. I assume you can fill in the cracks like they can, which is silly. How could you know everything that goes on in my brain?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In an attempt to make myself uncomfortable, I plan on having a few posts that are longer and more focused in addition to the more frequent short posts. I don't expect them to be as fun or as easy as the standard format but that's ok with me. You might learn something. I'll definitely learn something.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-------//-------</p>

        A Plethora of Brows
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2014</span>

    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>I received some constructive criticism from a few friends recently about the blog. Though It was not the criticism I expected, I welcomed it nonetheless. I was told that my blog can be too high brow because of some obscure references I make. I was surprised because I didn't think my blog had any brow at all. At the most, I assumed that my blog was primarily very low or lo- to-middle-brow -- also known as mustache. I appreciate the feedback, but I don't really know how to address this except for saying, "ok," and moving on.</p>
<p>Okay, let's move on.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I've made a playlist for this week. I decided to name it <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/4WAL87PUiBvinZ6npI3jgB">"Shirt Starched and Ready for Battle."</a> It has some music that I like on it. I've been doing a bit less music exploration recently. I became a bit supersaturated with music from Pitchfork Music Festival and have not quite gotten back into my next music discovery phase yet. I hope you like it.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I've decided to start a business. I'm optimistic, and I have the upmost confidence that I will fail. It's not that I don't think I can make something happen; I just know that there are a few things that are going to make starting a business difficult. As I see it, there are three major impediments to my startup. All of which are terrible, typical excuses that all aspiring entrepreneurs run into.</p>
<p>The first main problem is that I don't have a lot of time. I realize that saying I don't have a lot of time is a classic excuse but that's how I feel. It's tough to do a full work day, have a one-and-a-half hour commute, work out, write a blog -- however infrequently it actually gets published, talk to my roommate, feed myself, see my girlfriend, get the seven hours of sleep I never seem to get, and enjoy my many time consuming hobbies. Despite all of that, I'm ready -- today at least to make something that is mine.</p>
<p>The second roadblock to my startup success is the fact that I don't have a great idea; in fact, I don't have any ideas whatsoever. Whenever I ask people for "easy" company ideas, I always get the same answer: sell drugs. While I appreciate the input, I already work for a drug company. I don't think not being inspired will cause my business' failure. I know that if I think hard enough and often enough something -- no matter how mundane -- will come to me.</p>
<p>The final thing that is preventing me from starting is that I have no idea of how to start a business at all. I have all sorts of questions such as, do I pay taxes? When does it become an actual business? And so on. However, the reason I am starting a company that I know will fail is that I really want to <del>experience the embarrassing and debilitating pain of failure</del> learn what it is like to take ownership of an idea (and get paid for it too).</p>
<p>So, all of that being said, I'm excited and ready to do <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>There is a lot of opportunity out there. Technology lowers transaction costs while also making communication and automation easy. There are plenty of bad business ideas that succeed and plenty of good business ideas that don't. I want to start a business now because I want to. I don't need permission.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I've come to realize that I'm a victim of marketing.</p>
<p>I realized this after I got my cool travel coffee mug in the mail. I'm happy to have the mug. It has a cool, hip color scheme. It has the words "barista standard 12 oz cup" on the side; I don't know what this means, but it sounds cool. It's also made of post consumer plastic, which means -- and don't quote me on this -- it has something to do with the environment, and it's very 'in' right now.</p>
<p>While it may be 'hip', 'cool', and 'in', I spent $20 on a plastic coffee cup that doesn't keep my coffee warm.</p>
<p>My roommate also just told me that I can borrow his thermos. He has two he's never used before.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>One of my strengths is my enthusiasm for saying yes. I've found that people respond to this with enthusiasm. It makes them smile, and it makes people like me. I'm vain; I like the feeling of being liked.</p>
<p>Recently, I've come to realize, however, that this enthusiasm for saying yes to everything can also be a weakness. Because people like to hear yes, they will come back and ask for something else, knowing that I will likely be agreeable and interested in participating.</p>
<p>I'm very blessed with all of the opportunities I have and the people I have connections with. But I've found in "the post college world" -- where one has less time for everything and an ever-increasing amount of responsibilities -- that I need to learn how to become comfortable with saying "no." I also get quite tired. I run myself to the bone. As a result, I'm working on being more thoughtful with my time. So, if you find that I decline one of your offers, I hope you understand where I'm coming from.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I made an impulse Craig's List purchase. For $100, I am now the proud owner of: a five person tent, a Coleman gas grill, two camping chairs, a cooking kit, a mess kit, and camping cooking tools. I picked everything up from Ron.</p>
<p>When I drove up to Ron's mobile home, I saw him standing next to his car with a big closed lipped grin that hid his missing teeth. Ron is sixty-seven years old. He was incredibly nice and very excited to sell me his gear. Ron pulled out one piece of equipment after another.</p>
<p>"This is the tent," he told me. "It's big. It's not tall enough for you, but it's big."</p>
<p>After the display, we talked a bit. He promised that though the gear was good even though it was old. He told me about how he driven his motorcycle across the United States with all of this gear with his honey. He's seen a lot of beautiful things.</p>
<p>It was sad driving away with Ron's things, but I'm very excited to make sure the camping continues.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>Thank you, as always, for taking some time to read the blog. It really does mean a lot. If you have any questions, any business ideas, or just want to say "hey, what's up?", please send me an email at kidman007@gmail.com. I look forward to hear from you.</p>

        The Best Bad Idea I've Had in Years
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>Hello my friends,</p>
<p>Before we do anything, you should check out <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/56nGcKM7jhj0NwpVzp38Qt">this</a> playlist. I think there are a bunch of sweet tunes on it that you should check out (especially the last track).</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I'm a very impressionable person. This quirk manifested itself when I was listening to the "Tim Ferriss Show," hosted by Tim Ferriss, writer of "The Four Hour Work Week." Each episode he interviews some interesting, creative, high-performing individual and has a great conversation. In the last episode, I listened to him talk to a biochemist who focuses on nutrition and healthy living. Very casually, the biochemist mentioned that her breakfast every morning is a smoothie that contains the following: lots of kale, a handful of spinach, two carrots, a handful of frozen berries, an apple (optional), a banana (optional), an avocado, protein powder, and almond milk. The story intrigued me, as well as the smoothie, but I forgot about the whole thing immediately afterwords.</p>
<p>To my surprise, when I woke up the next morning, I found a huge bag of kale -- a pound and a half to be precise -- in my refrigerator. In addition, I found a boatload of fresh produce and more than enough protein powder to kill a horse. I'm glad to report that the smoothie was delicious and made me feel good all day. </p>
<p>While I'm glad I actually went out and bought the materials for the smoothie, I've got no idea what to do with the remaining 1.4 pounds of kale in my fridge. </p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>Paige just graduated from Lawrence and moved to Evanston. While this may be a run-of-the-mill idea for you -- or perhaps it's simply an unsurprising statement, it's a pretty big deal for me. After going through a year of a distance relationship, it's difficult to articulate how nice it is to be in the same place as Paige, so I won't try. I will say, however, that I'm very happy.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>Though I've made some attempts to stop thinking about the immediate future -- over thinking my career path was causing me a bit of anxiety, I have been doing a bit of day dreaming of what my midlife crisis is going to be. I've though about it a lot the last few weeks and I came up with this:</p>
<p>1) Pack up all of my bags and move to California.<br />
2) Live on the outskirts of town.<br />
3) Invest all of my money into a start-up.<br />
4) Ride a wave of undeserved success.<br />
5) Watch both my company and relationships fall apart.<br />
6) Get evicted from my house.<br />
7) Have the dog walk out on me.<br />
8) Starvation.<br />
9) Alcoholism.<br />
10) Disease.<br />
11) Eventual -- and inevitable -- death.</p>
<p>I like this plan because -- unlike most dreams -- it is actually possible to achieve. Sure, hunger, disease, and abandonment -- not to mention death -- all seem a bit unsavory; I'll admit that upfront. On the other hand. however, I hear that weather in California is nice year-round.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I'm trying to incorporate more writing into my life. I think of myself as a person who thinks. I think of myself as a person who has a good sense of humor. I really like the idea of writing my experiences and sharing them with other people via this blog on a regular basis. Unfortunately, this blog gets updated very infrequently. As I see it, I have two major roadblocks that I have to overcome in order to make this blog what I want it to be. First, is that I am lazy. I'm not too busy to write; blaming business is a form of laziness. In response to this, I've been coming up with plans and routines to enable myself to write every day. Sitting down and writing is not the only area where my laziness gets in the way; I also stall on aggregating the bits of what I write up and actually publish them.  The second roadblock is that I'm still pretty self-conscience about my writing. Unfortunately, this does not translate into me editing more, it just means I publish less. </p>
<p>So, my friends, this is where you come in. If you have any feedback on how I write, what I write about, what you think is interesting, what you think is boring, what literary devices I use too much, what grammatical errors I make, I'd love to hear your feedback because I really am trying to learn. I'm trying to get better.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope all is as good with you as it is with me. Send me a message at Kidman007@gmail.com. I'd love to hear from you.</p>

    <span class="post-date">21 May 2014</span>

    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>I came up with a great idea the other day. I'm happy about the idea because I've acutally talked a few of my co-workers into doing it. Here's the idea: I'm going to bike to work. At first glance, this doesnt sound too impressive, as it is fairly common for people to ride their bike to work. And even when I explain the caveats some of you will still be wondering why this is interesting. But wait! Work for me is twenty-six miles away, and, in order to get there, I'm going to have to navigate the wild streets of Chicago before arriving at the mighty Catamaran Tower. I'm pretty excited. </p>
<p>I recently got a new bike (well, actually it's quite used). When I first saw the bike in the used bike store, it didn't have a front wheel and the handle bars were lying next to it on the floor. When my new friend John pointed at is and said, "this one will fit you," he smiled. He then said, "I'm not done with this one yet, but I've been working on this bike like it was one of my own." From that point on, any logic that went into buying my bike evaporated. It's a great bike and I'm happy to have it.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I'd like to be in a life threatening situation sometime soon. I obviously don't want to die, and I definitely don't want to go through this experience alone. The reason I want to do this is simple; traumatic experiences bring people together in ways unlike any other. You could sit on the train with someone everyday for an entire year and I'd bet that you wouldn't feel as close to that person as you would if the train flew off the tracks and you helped each other survive the burning wreckage (especially if one - or both - of you lose a limb in the process). Another part of me wants to be able to introduce someone by saying, "This is my friend Alphonso. He saved my life in 2014." After that, Alhonzo and I would give a great high five with our left hands and I would say, "We both lost our right arm in a tragic incident at the zoo."</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I really like the idea of moving around in a company. While there is sometime to be said about to having an expertise, something that you can do better than pretty much anyone, I like the idea of having a wide breadth of skills and experiences . The way I see it, it is a lot easier to pick up the basics and be proficient at a new skill than it is to gain an equivalent amount of increased expertise on a skill you are already an expert in. Also, I like the idea of cross fertilization of ideas. It's super neat when you see someone from one discipline find a way to improve another discipline because of their different perspective.</p>
<p>I was worrying for a while about my future and what I would do. Now I think I'll have just a few personal goals and try to get as much crazy and varied experiences as possible in both work and life in general.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>There are two things I'm working on: taking risks and saying no. I've been inundated recently by articles about entrepreneurship, and my brain has had  an inexplicable desire to try keep on trying to achieve goals or projects with a medium to high chance of failure. That being said, I also have a desire to do good work, which requires extended focus and the ability to not bite off more than I can chew. It's weird to have both desires and only have 24 hours in a day. </p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>I recommend that you pick up the collection of stories, "Letter from an Unknown Woman," by Stephan Zweig. I've only read the first story , which shares the same name as the collection, and I loved it. I jumped from confused to intrigued to sad in the span of sixty pages. </p>
<p>I discovered Zweig by way of Wes Andrewson.  Anderson's latest film,"Grand Budapest Hotel," was inspired by the works of Zweig. The movie was great and so is Zweig.</p>
<p>-------//-------</p>
<p>Well, I'm off. I feel like this post was more for me than for youbut that's ok. If you want to be added to the mailing list or just want to say hi, drop me an email at kidman007@gmail.com. I'd love to hear from you. </p>
<p>Edit:<br />
After getting some feedback from a few loyal readers, I realized how poorly edited this post is. Rather than getting frustrated about the poor grammar that I've tried so hard to improve on, I'm going to take this post as a polite suggestion to get some sleep.</p>
