    <h3 id="the-part-where-i-apologize-for-doing-something-no-one-ever-asked-me-to-do">The part where I apologize for doing something no one ever asked me to do</h3>

<p>My name is Andrew Kraemer. I live in Madison. I am tall. I am simple. I talk a lot. I use periods where most people would put commas.</p>

<p>I started a blog on Wordpress a long time ago, and I haven’t added anything to it for a year and a half. The blog was an opportunity for me to explore my enjoyment of language and work on my writing anxiety. For the most part, the blog worked. I think I’m a better writer for it. I struggle a lot less with writer’s block as a result. Looking back on the blog, I’m impressed with the consistency I was able to publish content — despite the limited free time I had when I wrote it. Moving to Madison was a significant turning point in my life, which I failed to capture and share on my blog. That’s okay. I did other things. Change, it turns out, is hard.</p>

<p>I have recently decided to start the blog up again. A friend of mine asked me why I stopped writing. I opened my mouth, then I closed my mouth. I opened my mouth up again and said the words, “Honestly, I don’t really remember.”</p>

<p>I’m not a doctor, but I don’t think , “I don’t remember” is a particularly good reason to do or not do anything. So here we are again, a new blog on a new website with new words. The new website is my attempt to get better at some of the backend coding that comes with working on the internet. The words are for me and you. We can share the words like a team.</p>

<p>Let’s get back to fun things.</p>

<h3 id="the-classically-funny-part-at-the-expense-of-a-stranger">The classically funny part at the expense of a stranger</h3>

<p>My first year in Madison I lived with my dear friend, Tony Darling. Tony was an excellent roommate. Tony was my plus one for everything — from jogging to concerts; we even accidentally went to a pyramid scheme presentation together.</p>

<p>We were scammed as a duo.</p>

<p>Tony Darling is now in Russia, which is very far away from Madison. I am proud of him, but he needed to be replaced.</p>

<p>My new roommate is Kevin Tran. Kevin Tran is from a place called <em>Craigslist</em>. Kevin Tran and I have a very good relationship. The following is an exhaustive list detailing our relationship:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If we are both in the kitchen cooking something, we make eye contact, and we say, “Hey.”</li>
  <li>If I am in the living room singing and playing the guitar and Kevin Tran walks by me to go the kitchen, we do not make eye contact, and we do not say, “Hey.”</li>
  <li>If one of us were to die, the other wouldn’t notice until the smell of the decaying corpse became an issue.</li>
  <li>We share the cost of rent.</li>
  <li>Kevin pays more for rent than I do.
It took some time to learn how to deal with Post Tony Supergoodtimes Depression (PTSD), but now I have Kevin Tran. Kevin Tran is fine.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-part-that-focuses-on-a-select-audience">The part that focuses on a select audience</h3>
<p>So far, March has been phenomenal. March has been much better than February. All of February, I felt sick and lethargic, which is unfortunate because February was beautiful. The Germans have a work for this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springtime_lethargy">Frühjahrsmüdigkeit</a>, which is a fancy German way of blaming my sickness on the increasing of the temperatures, rather than not allowing myself to rest and recover. Thank you, Germans for this word.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to visit my dear friends in both the Twin Cities and Seattle these last few weekends. Seeing my friends brought me an incredible amount of joy. However, it’s more like a joy that is personal and soaked in nostalgia — rather than one that is easily explained to internet at large. I just have this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you my good friends for being excellent</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-part-where-i-suggest-things">The part where I suggest things</h3>
<p>I made sure to optimize Frühjahrsmüdigkeit, by watching several good movies. <em>Captain Fantastic</em> is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I love everything about this movie. I could argue that it was my favorite of 2016. It’s distilled whimsy and intelligence.</p>

<p>I also really liked <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em>. If you didn’t like <em>Cloverfield</em>, you should probably watch this anyway. John Goodman kills it in this one. It’s scary in a wonderful way.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/kidman007/playlist/2ZqNeGaS08ga03TmmrEVjn">this</a> playlist for you. It’s called <em>Distilled Friendship</em>.</p>

<h3 id="the-part-where-i-thank-you">The part where I thank you</h3>
<p>It’s been a really good year and a half. Lots has happened, and I — for once in my life — had to stop myself from writing. Sometimes I’ve been creative and other times I’ve been lazy. Regardless, it’s always nice to share, and I always appreciate you reading. More to come soon.</p>

<p>Your friend,</p>

<p>Andrew</p>

        I Think I'll Call This One 'Madison'
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2015</span>

    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>Well, I made it to Madison.</p>
<p>Often times, when I’m writing a blog post, I’ll write out what’s on my mind in my snazzy notebook. It helps me get my thoughts out fast and dirty. It’s also the notebook I bought so that when I go into coffee shops, like the one I’m in now, people will know that I went to a liberal arts school — or at the very least that I’m a *creative* person. It’s like a Moleskine, but it’s a different brand. That’s how creative I am.</p>
<p>Though it’s nice signaling to everyone how creative I am, I’ll admit that it’s disappointing when I opened my notebook today and saw that I haven’t written in my *creative* notebook since I was taking notes for my interview at wellbe.</p>
<p>— This means at least two things<br />
1. It has been a full month since I interviewed for the position that I started yesterday<br />
<del>2. My assumption that it would be easier to write about my transition from Chicago to Madison would be easier once I left Catamaran — now Optum — was wrong. Or maybe it wasn’t wrong because I guess that I’m writing about my move right now, because here I am — in a cafe — writing about writing. Regardless, I thought that it would be easier to write about moving to Madison because I was afraid that someone at work would find out, which — in retrospect — is a ridiculous thing to worry about. I guess I really wanted to avoid an unlikely — but definitely possible — situation where a boss would find out I was looking to move and I got fired before I was able to secure a job in Madison. For instance, I could have posted a blog post about moving to Madison on Twitter and one of the famous people who follow me — like Taylor Swift — could have retweeted it. As a result, a tween (do people still say that?) would show their parent the post out of sympathy for the author (me). That parent would end up being my boss’s boss’s boss, who would see that I was planning on leaving and then fire me. As a result, I would be found dead by the side of I-94 between Milwaukee and Madison. Cause of death would be declared as “confusion.”</del><br />
2. I got sidetracked and did something else.</p>
<p>Regardless, now that I’m free to say and do what I want, I can happily say that I am moving to Madison and I couldn’t be happier. Paige got a job at Epic Systems. I’m following her there. I’ll admit I was hesitant about the move at first. After talking about it, I realized that the main reason I didn’t want to go was because I was afraid. It’s usually best to ignore fear.</p>
<p>I’ve been throwing around the phrase ‘Lifestyle Engineering’ a fair amount when talking about moving to Madison. With two years of city living under my belt, I feel that I’ve got a better understanding of what I want my day to day to look like. For instance, assuming I get the apartment I want, my commute will do down from an hour-and-a-half to fifteen minutes. It’s also fourty-five minutes by bike, which has been my dream commute since I learned what a commute really is. With this dream apartment I’ll also be just a two blocks from Paige (the best!), a block from the lake (great!), living with Mr. Tony Susan Darling (groovy!), and I’ll be downtown (super!). Everything has been chosen carefully, so all I need to do is keep trying to be interesting.</p>
<p>My new job is exciting, cool, and fast paced. It’s also terrifying because I’m incredibly under-qualified, but — again — I’m working my best on ignoring fear.</p>
<p>I hope you come to Madison to visit. It’s close to all of my favorite places, so both of us — me and you — don’t have an excuse to not see each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;line-height:150%;">———//———</p>
<p>My friend Andrew Calderon, who I’ve always called Pescado, also blogs. He’s a phenomenal writer and writes on really interesting topics. You can check out his most recent post [here].</p>
<p style="text-align:center;line-height:150%;">———//———</p>
<p>I’m hoping in the next few months to convert my website from a Wordpress website to my own website. If you have any expertise in website creation, I might be reaching out to you for some hot tips.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;line-height:150%;">———//———</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Maybe I’ll get the courage (ignore fear) to publish something a little more creative. Anyway, feel free to drop me a message at kidman007@gmail.com. Let’s catch up.</p>

        Twitter in the Most Hallowed of Places
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>It was the middle of the day in a bathroom stall on the ninth floor of the Catamaran headquarters when I realized I needed to change my relationship with Twitter. My phone was in my hands with the iconic blue bird glowing on my screen. I blinked and wondered long I had been sitting there.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long ago I actually wanted to understand Twitter better; now I wish I understood it less. Friends and coworkers were always talking about conversations they had and the interesting articles people shared on Twitter. Apparently, comedians say funny things on there as well. I like funny. At that point, I still didn’t understand Twitter. I didn’t know who I should follow, or where to find good content. I was stranger in a party everyone else was familiar with. I wanted in.</p>
<p>So, I made it my mission to get the most out of Twitter. I followed modern entrepreneur personalities I admire, such as Tim Ferriss and James Altucher. I followed podcasters I enjoyed like Alex Blumburg and John Hodgeman. I looked into the “Weird Twitter” subculture, which is — unsurprisingly — weird. The list goes on.</p>
<p>After a few months of pretending to like Twitter, I finally realized that I was going to Twitter willingly — I actually liked it. I checked it often and it became a nice break in my day. I was honestly embarrassed about how happy — the word “gushed” might be the best description of how I felt — I was when my favorite economist, Russ Roberts (@EconTalker), <a href="https://twitter.com/EconTalker/status/609355119306665984">responded to my Tweet</a>. I was glowing.</p>
<ul>
<li>I checked Twitter at my desk.</li>
<li>I checked Twitter while driving my car. (danger!)</li>
<li>I checked Twitter at the gym.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was sitting in the most hallowed and private places for a cube warrior: the bathroom stall, when I realized that I was checking Twitter too much.</p>
<p>(It’s gross, I get it, but bear with me.)</p>
<p>The stall is the perfect place to check your phone — so I shouldn’t have felt self conscious about checking Tweets in there. It’s one of the few private places in an office where you can’t be seen — image is important (or so they say). Though I was seeing a lot of cool things in the "Twitterverse," I realized that I was trying to escape my day — my reality — by filling any momentary void in my day with a massive mental download of media while in the bathroom. I had become the Scarface of Twitter (deluded — not murderous or coked out or the king).</p>
<p>When I came to this realization, I made a swift decision — a instant promise to myself. Before I check Twitter while in the most hallowed of places, I must journal. I must write one-hundred words before I read dozen of one-hundred-and-forty word snippets. I must create something before I blindly consume.</p>
<p>So far it’s worked, and It’s made me feel a lot better. Maybe tomorrow I’ll find another way to create more. Maybe not.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;line-height:150%;">———//———</p>
<p>It’s summer time now, so I’ve been trying lots of new things and doing new things too.</p>
<p>I just had my first improv show with my class. I like to over-analyze how I did, but I know in my heart of hearts we did great for our first time. My whole family watched me, which was great. Two of my good friends, Matt and T. Susan Darling, came down to see me from Wisconsin, which was also great. Paige was there — great greatness.</p>
<p>I want to build my own website. I have a website now — you’re looking at it — but I want to actually build a website. In order to achieve this goal, I’ve started using <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp.com</a>, which has been a good learning experience. I’m still a long way off before I can do anything on my own, though.</p>
<p>Paige is in Prague. Jared is in Ireland. I miss them a lot. On the other hand, I’ve now got more time to write my blog. It’s better when they’re here, though.</p>
<p>I’m reading a few books right now. “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” and “Cosmos.” Both are great. I'll probably need to read something simple and light to ground me after I'm done with these books, like Kafka.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;line-height:150%;">———//———</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this! I really appreciate you! If you’d like to be added to the mailing list, send me an email at kidman007@gmail.com or Tweet at me @kidman007 (fuel my habit).</p>

    <span class="post-date">18 May 2015</span>

    <p>“And then the roof fell in.” I’ve been waiting for a sentence like this to happen for a while. I’ve been looking for a focal point — a conversation starter. Other things have happened — curious things, but I have been having trouble with finding the magical sentence that has you, my faithful reader, drawn in.</p>
<p>I was happy. I had gotten Paige interested in my book, “How Not to be Wrong.” It’s a fun book — like Freakanomics with a focus on math instead of Econ. Paige — being a math major — became interested. We were reading on my Kindle together. It was cute. I was happy. We looked over at the ceiling — it was making a cracking noise. </p>
<p>And then the roof fell in. </p>
<p>Paige had pointed out the cracks in the ceiling of her apartment previously. “The cracks are getting bigger,” she would say. “I wouldn’t worry about it,” I would say. I was wrong.</p>
<p>It’s times like these I realize that I prefer it when things are slightly wrong. In music, I like it when the singer can’t quite sing well, or the guitar is a little too noisy. Sure, in life I appreciate it when things are going well. Paige and I went to yoga, we ate schwarma, we enjoyed the good weather. We even watched three episodes of House of Cards. All of these things, though fun, are not the things I remember. I remember shouting as the plaster fell from ceiling next to my face. I remember the silence as we processed the what happened. Was there really a hole in her ceiling? Is that something that happens?</p>
<p>We are often told if we *succeed* at different things we will be happy. Do a good job at work. Exercise. Get brunch. Sometimes though it’s better to be scared; it’s good to be surprised. </p>
<p>————//————</p>
<p>I’ve had more energy lately, so I’ve been able to do some “Andrew things.” </p>
<p>I’ve been reading a lot of books, which is good, because books make your brain larger. Like I mentioned before, I’m going through “How Not to be Wrong.” It’s been a great way to connect with math again without opening a difficult text book. I finished Dave Egger’s book, “A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,” last week. It was a great read. I found, however, that it was messing with how I write. It made my — already sporadic — way of writing even more all over the place. I’m reading a book on yoga called “Light on Yoga,” because I know that even though I’ll never be able to bench 200 lbs, I might be able to touch my toes. Unfortunately, I’ve found reading doesn’t make you more flexible.</p>
<p>I started a sci-fi book called 2313. I’m not sure if I’ll stick with it, because it’s massive, but we’ll see. I’m flying through this book by improvisors Tj and Dave. The writing and the organization of the book is bad, but the concepts are great.</p>
<p>I’m working on learning how to write JavaScript. Codeacademy.com has been a really good resource. The class is engaging enough for me to keep on it — even after it gets more difficult after the basics.</p>
<p>Improv is going well as well. My class is great. We have started to meet outside of class to practice, which, so far, has been very successful. In June, we’ll have our first performance. I really can’t wait.</p>
<p>I’ve started listening to rap. </p>
<p>———//———</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. I hope you have a killer day. I hope tomorrow is better. I hope the day after that is even better.</p>

    <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2015</span>

    <p>I’ve been trying to write this post for a while now. It’s about something that makes me very happy — in addition to my wonderful girlfriend, Paige. It’s about improv.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about struggling writing about improv is that it goes against the ideas of improv. For instance, there are no mistakes in improv — only happy accidents and opportunities. There isn’t any fear in improv — only showing off your best weird self.</p>
<p>When I write about improv, this new passion of mine, I worry about mistakes. I am afraid that I won’t articulate the feelings accurately. If I can’t do that, why bother write about the feelings at all? This has resulted in me rewriting this post several times. This is the last time I’ll write this post. I promise.</p>
<p>——//——</p>
<p>“Improv is all about relationships,” Kimmie told us as she walked back and forth in front of the class. “It’s not about being funny; being funny will come. Trust me. Give the audience a reason to care about the scene.”</p>
<p>Kimmie is my improv teacher at The Second City. She is also a badass — a hilarious, outrageous, enthusiastic, and weird badass. Working with her and my classmates over the last two months has — quite simply — made my life better.</p>
<p>When I first signed up for improv classes, I thought that I would learn how to be funny. My internal monologue told me that that I’m already hilarious and fearless. I thought that’s all it took to be a great improviser. Improv classes, I assumed, would be a cake walk.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>After every exercise, which is usually filled with false starts and stumbles, Kimmie asks us, “Well, what did we learn?” I always want to respond with “a lot.”</p>
<p>It turns out improv is really hard. To be successful at it, you have to behave like a good friend to your partner:<br />
You have to listen.<br />
You have to react.<br />
You have to add something to the conversation.<br />
You need to be open.<br />
And you can’t be afraid.</p>
<p>Improv puts a magnifying glass on the way we behave. Of course the scene is better when you listen to your partner, listening is the key to other interactions, why not improv scenes? Of course a scene is going to be better when you have a relationship at the center of everything, conversations in general are better when there is a relationship. The more realism and attention you bring to the table, the better you do.</p>
<p>This applies to both life and improv.</p>
<p>The class is full of these revelations. It’s doing all of these things that we should be doing anyway. It’s not about fabricating reality. It’s about creating an alternate reality (the difference is subtle but significant). This challenge makes it fun and keeps me coming back for more.</p>
<p>My new improv friends are great. All of the people are young, enthusiastic about the art form,  about hanging out, and watching improv shows. It’s like I found a secret group of goofy people that were hiding until now.</p>
<p>The group is interesting because everyone is very different. We all have different interests and careers, but everyone in the class is the sort of person who would sign up for an introductory improv class. In other words, everyone is a little weird, inexperienced, and willing to pay money to make a fool of themselves. We are getting drinks after class tonight.</p>
<p>It’s exciting to be with these people because we are excited to be together. Some of us are already talking about performing. On a stage. With an audience. I expect you to be there, reader.</p>
<p>Improv is good for Paige and I as well. It an outlet for us to explore the city. It’s an outlet for us to see new people. While I haven’t persuaded her to sign up for a class yet, I’m really happy we’ve found something new we can enjoy together. It means we we’ll watch less Netflix, but I’m okay with that. The more things we do together the better! Paige + improv = Pimprov, which is Russian for love.</p>
<p>Tonight I start the second level of improv classes. Though I won't have Kimmie teaching me, she has promised the other teachers are quite good as well. Most of the people from my first class have joined the second class. Today I'll be better than I was yesterday. Maybe someday I'll be quite good. I'll hold my breath.</p>
<p>——//——</p>
<p>Thank you for reading! I like improv. I wish I could do a better job explaining my feelings about it. Let me know if you want to catch up! Let me know if you want to be on the email list! Shoot me a message at <a href="mailto:andrew.h.kraemer@gmail.com">andrew.h.kraemer@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>I’ll probably write a more comprehensive post about improv after I get a bit more experience.</p>
