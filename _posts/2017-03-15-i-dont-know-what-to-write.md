## So we might as well start here:

My name is Andrew Kraemer. I live in Madison. I am tall. I am simple. I talk a lot. I use periods where most people would put commas.

I started a blog on Wordpress a long time ago, and I haven’t added anything to it for a year and a half. The blog was an opportunity for me to explore my enjoyment of language and work on my writing anxiety. For the most part, the blog worked. I think I’m a better writer for it. I struggle a lot less with writers block as a result. Looking back on the blog, I’m impressed with the consistency I was able to publish content — despite the limited free time I had when I wrote it. Moving to Madison was a significant turning point in my life, which I failed to capture and share on my blog. That’s okay. I did other things. Change, it turns out, is hard.

I have recently decided to start the blog up again. A friend of mine asked me why I stopped writing. I opened my mouth, then I closed my mouth. I opened my mouth up again and said the words, “Honestly, I don’t really remember.”

I’m not a doctor, but I don’t think , “I don’t remember” is a particularly good reason to do or not do anything. So here we are again, a new blog on a new website with new words. The new website is my attempt to get better at some of the backend coding that comes with working on the internet. The words are for me and you. We can share the words like a team.

Let’s get back to fun things.

My first year in Madison I lived with my dear friend, Tony Darling. Tony was an excellent roommate. Tony was my plus one for everything — from jogging to concerts; we even accidentally went to a pyramid scheme presentation together.

We were scammed as a duo.

Tony Darling is now in Russia, which is very far away from Madison. I am proud of him, but I had to replace him.

My new roommate is Kevin Tran. Kevin Tran is from a place called *Craigslist*. Kevin Tran and I have a very good relationship. The following is an exhaustive list detailing our relationship:
- If we are both in the kitchen cooking something, we make eye contact, and we say, “Hey.”
- If I am in the living room singing and playing the guitar and Kevin Tran walks by me to go the kitchen, we do not make eye contact, and we do not say, “Hey.”
- If one of us were to die, the other wouldn’t notice until the smell of the decaying corpse became an issue.
- We share the cost of rent.
- Kevin pays more for rent than I do.
It took some time to learn how to deal with Post Tony Supergoodtimes Depression (PTSD), but now I have Kevin Tran. Kevin Tran is fine.

So far, March has been phenomenal. March has been much better than February. All of February, I experienced Frühjahrsmüdigkeit, which is a fancy German way of blaming my sickness on the increasing of the temperatures, rather than not allowing myself to rest and recover. Thank you, Germans.
